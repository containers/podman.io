Red Hat has a community program called Red Hat Accelerators which gives you access to Red Hat engineering and leadership. I believe it was just announced today: https://access.redhat.com/accelerators#overview\nReinhard Tartler11:17 AM\nHi, I'm Reinhard, long-term Debian and Ubuntu Core Developer (13 years), and I've integrated podman 2.0.6 into the upcoming Debian 11 and Ubuntu 20.10 releases. I'm located in New York and work at Bloomberg leading a team working on a firmwide integration build system\nBrent Baude11:17 AM\n@Reinhard, please to meet you\nScott McCarty11:20 AM\n@Reinhard, that is super exciting to hear!\nLokesh S Mandvekar11:21 AM\nthanks a ton Reinhard :)\nJoe Doss (jdoss)11:24 AM\nAny plans for improved systemd integration with rootless?\nBrent Baude11:25 AM\nid encourage you to ask ... and specify what exactly you want\nJoe Doss (jdoss)11:25 AM\nSpecifically running systemd units with the User= directive calling podman rootless.\nJA11:27 AM\nCould you elaborate on the timing of integration of podman 2.x and 3.x into certain RHEL 8.x releases?\nmheon11:27 AM\n@JA - Podman 2.0 is 8.3.0, Podman 2.1 in 8.3.1\nNot sure about 3.0 yet - perhaps 8.4.0 if we make the deadline there\nReinhard Tartler11:28 AM\nQ: What versions of podman/buildah/skopeo can we expect to end up in RHEL7 (RHEL8)? - I'm asking because I need to decide what version to integrate for Debian 11, and would love to hear some opinions.\nChristian Felder11:29 AM\nfollow up on JA's question. Will this go into another module stream though?\nmheon11:30 AM\n@Reinhard - RHEL7 is now frozen on 1.6.4\nRHEL8 has two streams, one rolling steadily to the latest release, one with long-term-support releases\nBalamurugan11:30 AM\nwhat is the latest podman stable release for rhel 8.2\nDouglas11:30 AM\nHey Tom, what's the current status of running kind on top of podman?\nmheon11:31 AM\nTragically, the 2.0 module does not have Podman 2.0\nWe may have made a naming error, there...\nChristian Felder11:32 AM\nalright, to get the latest stuf just stay on rhel8 stream though\nmheon11:33 AM\n@Douglas - RHEL 8.2 has 1.6.4 in both streams. 8.2.1 has the fast-moving stream upgraded from 1.6.4 to 1.9.3\n@Christian - yes, RHEL8 stream is rolling to the latest\nChristian Felder11:33 AM\nthanks\nReinhard Tartler11:34 AM\nI'd love to see the Debian images added to the \"well-known\" list :-)\nDouglas11:34 AM\nnot sure if I follow mheon :(\nmy question is regarding kind - kubernetes\nmheon11:35 AM\nOh, sorry, replied to the wrong person\nThat was re: Balamurugan\nDouglas11:35 AM\nno worries\nAlex Litvak11:35 AM\nReinhard, is there a chance of podman backported to 20.04 LTS on ubuntu ?\nBalamurugan11:35 AM\nthanks @mheon\nAlex Litvak11:36 AM\nspeaking of a package of course\nDouglas11:39 AM\nthanks. Going to retest in a fresh git clone.\nmanish11:40 AM\ngvisor with podman.? is possible near future?\nBrent Baude11:41 AM\n@Tom, can I ask questions?\nmheon11:41 AM\n@manish - Should work fine as root. Rootless would require support from the gvisor folks\nJust need to add it as a runtime to containers.conf\nAlex Litvak11:42 AM\nany comments on the future logging support similar to docker?\nmanish11:43 AM\nthanks mheon.\nJA11:43 AM\nDoes the podman team work with the Quay team about registry interactions - access control features? ability to move older images to a different registry with different permissions? maybe these are quay questions...\nDrew Bailey11:43 AM\npodman go api -- any updates around https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/6866\nBrent Baude11:44 AM\nDrew, let's sdiscuss now!\nJoe Doss (jdoss)11:48 AM\nDo you folks plan on publishing a pubic road map that shows community and Red Hat needs/wants for features/bug?\nMe11:48 AM\nTopics for next time? Please add to: https://hackmd.io/fc1zraYdS0-klJ2KJcfC7w\nDrew Bailey11:52 AM\n\ud83d\udc4d awesome thanks, will help us get off varlink :D\nJoe Doss (jdoss)11:57 AM\nI think it would be nice for the community to have insights into what is important for the RH Podman Team and maybe the community can help. Also design direction within the roadmap would help inform community help.\nhelp guide community help**\nJoe Doss (jdoss)11:59 AM\nWe can help if we know what direction you folks want to go.\nSally O'Malley11:59 AM\nthank you everyone! i have to drop - see you all next month\nBrent Baude11:59 AM\njoe you are exactly correct.\nmanish12:00 PM\nthanks :)\nJoe Doss (jdoss)12:00 PM\nGreat call and turnout!\nValentin Rothberg12:00 PM\nThanks for joining, all!\n")))}Re.isMDXComponent=!0;const Le={},Oe="Podman Community Meeting",Ge=[{value:"April 6, 2021 08:00 p.m. Eastern (UTC-4)",id:"april-6-2021-0800-pm-eastern-utc-4",level:2},{value:"Attendees (18 total)",id:"attendees-18-total",level:3},{value:"Meeting Start: 8:00 p.m.",id:"meeting-start-800-pm",level:2},{value:"BlueJeans Recording",id:"bluejeans-recording",level:3},{value:"Podman Commit Topic Standards",id:"podman-commit-topic-standards",level:2},{value:"Matt Heon",id:"matt-heon",level:3},{value:"(2:17 in the video)",id:"217-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Podman v3.1 Preview",id:"podman-v31-preview",level:2},{value:"Matt Heon",id:"matt-heon-1",level:3},{value:"(3:00 in the video)",id:"300-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"U volume flag to chown source volumes",id:"u-volume-flag-to-chown-source-volumes",level:2},{value:"Eduardo Vega",id:"eduardo-vega",level:3},{value:"(6:58 in the video)",id:"658-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Demo (8:30 in the video)",id:"demo-830-in-the-video",level:5},{value:"Podman on Mac Preview",id:"podman-on-mac-preview",level:2},{value:"Brent Baude/Ashley Cui",id:"brent-baudeashley-cui",level:3},{value:"(15:20 in the video)",id:"1520-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Demo (19:22 in the video)",id:"demo-1922-in-the-video",level:5},{value:"Questions?",id:"questions",level:2},{value:"(35:00) in the video)",id:"3500-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Topics for Next Meeting",id:"topics-for-next-meeting",level:2},{value:"Next Meeting: Tuesday May 4, 2021, 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-4)",id:"next-meeting-tuesday-may-4-2021-1100-am-eastern-utc-4",level:2},{value:"Meeting End: 8:43 p.m. Eastern (UTC-4)",id:"meeting-end-843-pm-eastern-utc-4",level:3},{value:"BlueJeans Chat copy/paste:",id:"bluejeans-chat-copypaste",level:2}],Ye={toc:Ge},Fe="wrapper";function qe(e){let{components:t,...n}=e;return(0,Ne.kt)(Fe,(0,ce.Z)({},Ye,n,{components:t,mdxType:"MDXLayout"}),(0,Ne.kt)("h1",{id:"podman-community-meeting"},"Podman Community Meeting"),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"april-6-2021-0800-pm-eastern-utc-4"},"April 6, 2021 08:00 p.m. Eastern (UTC-4)"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"attendees-18-total"},"Attendees (18 total)"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Tom Sweeney, Brent Baude, Jhon Honce, Dan Walsh, Chris Evich, Lokesh Mandvekar, Urvashi Mohnani, Nalin Dahyabhai, Eduardo Santiago, Matt Heon, Ashley Cui, Sumantro Mukherjee, Scott McCarty, Shion Tanaka, Juanje Ojeda, Edward Shen, Reinhard Tartler"),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"meeting-start-800-pm"},"Meeting Start: 8:00 p.m."),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"bluejeans-recording"},"BlueJeans ",(0,Ne.kt)("a",{parentName:"h3",href:"https://bluejeans.com/s/@f3vA2PsK7a"},"Recording")),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"podman-commit-topic-standards"},"Podman Commit Topic Standards"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"matt-heon"},"Matt Heon"),(0,Ne.kt)("h4",{id:"217-in-the-video"},"(2:17 in the video)"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"If you're fixing a bug or an issue, please include a link to the commit message or at least in a comment."),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"podman-v31-preview"},"Podman v3.1 Preview"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"matt-heon-1"},"Matt Heon"),(0,Ne.kt)("h4",{id:"300-in-the-video"},"(3:00 in the video)"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Matt pulled up the release notes (",(0,Ne.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES.md"},"https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES.md"),").

This comes into play when you're pushing partial images. If we move to this, which uses zstd instead of gzip, it could potentialy break Docker and other container engine compatibility. The thought is to give users a number of conversion formats that could be used when pushing images. This may require two images to be pushed at the same time. Likely a containers.conf setting to select compression algorithm or to allow multiple pushes at once. Valentin had thought that when selecting an image from a manifest or an oci index, many clients pick the first one. So existing clients would cointinue to work. If we want to do the cstandard search, we'd have to traverse the full list first. Very early design discussions are going on. He expects cost to be minimal as traversing the manifest list is much smaller than the images on the repository. So gzip would still be in play to keep other container engines happy, but newer versions could start pushing this new zstd format. Once we have a prototype, this will be opened up to OCI for further review. We could then create PR's in other container engines such as Docker.

People can also change the text after it was created.\nTom Sweeney: Hello everybody. Welcome to the Clubman community meeting today is Tuesday, April 4, 2023. Just as a reminder, we are. We have this meeting every other month on the even numbered months, we talked about all things podman or containers with any kind of demo or discussions along those lines. Topics are driven by people sending me stuff for me asking people or people coming along and or sometimes within our groups being asked to set something here. And again, anything for pop, man, build a Scorpio or any of their Well, probably be helpful if I actually shared my screen as well.\nTom Sweeney:  Build our Scorpio and related projects, I'll be taking meeting notes today within the hack. MD, If you see something that put in that's incorrect or you want to add a link or something to that, please feel free to do so. And then for today, we will be talking about net of our plugins with Paul Holzinger. Then Ashley Q, Ashley will be doing a five man, machine OS demonstration for us. And then that will be talking about podman updates for to the database that we're working on right now coming out soon. And then we'll be talking about topics for next meeting And/or. Any open discussions that you want to have So, with all that, I'm going to stop presenting and I'm going to hand it over to Paul.\nPaul Holzinger:  Okay. I am going to share the screen.\nPaul Holzinger: so, none of our plugins is for a way to Manage certain extra wishes which you want in your network setup. So with C&i where you could customize a lot, you could write your own plugins and network only supported Bridge. Make VLAN and no IPV then.\nPaul Holzinger: that's, That's good, but not enough for some users. So, with the next version we gonna introduce plug-in support and network, And I'm going to show very quick. I have a small example. Written in. Rust.\nPaul Holzinger:  It's so the concept is pretty simple, you're plugging can create a network config. Then it needs to do. set up, which is just, Like, set up would be. Creating an interface in a container namespace and connecting it to the host. And you can do pretty much what you want. That's whatever you call. And tear down should pretty much. Be the inverse of setup. So we moved in the face again. And yeah, that's that's pretty much it. That I can. I can link to PR afterwards where there's a documentation holder. And convict chase and looks and how it works. Pretty much. And with that, I have a simple.\nPaul Holzinger:  Simple plugin here. Host device plugin. I Copied to the. User local like never Mark directory, which can be configured and containers.com. And now, if I have to. Portman info. I should see. On the network that it detected. The plugin here. and that means I should be able to do a simple portman network create Driver. And then host device plugin. And the host device. Plugin is example, is just very simple one that Most host interface into the container, and if you stop the container, we move the interface back to the host.\nPaul Holzinger:  And that there's a new option. I will editor in something.\nPaul Holzinger:  Interface Name and I create already created an interface like on my host. I have a test one. And then I give a network name. Also test one so I can show the interface. Just one. And if, you know, run a container, Apartment run. Network test One. Alpine. And take a look. Test one must moved in. And if I show again, it's back. So if I Run this in the background pretty quick. Just to show that. It was really moved 10 seconds. Let's see the interface is gone.\n00:05:00\nPaul Holzinger:  If we made this moment,\nPaul Holzinger: no, no I'm just yeah now the container stopped it's big so,\nPaul Holzinger:  Let's just a very simple example. You can. Code, whatever you want in there. And I provided a simple rust interface. To automatically take care of. the so it's a it's a external binary you have A sub command for create, for setup for teardown. And if you use the Small rust binding. It will take care of the setup and stuff and then you just Let me see if I can increase the size. Yes.\nPaul Holzinger:  like the that's the pretty much what you need in your plugin and you import You import the trade? And then, you must define. a create function, a setup function, which gets the like the path for the network and Yeah, this settings like the third like the network config I can. it's You get order in for you, you can put in a network config and do whatever you're like. So if you do the\nPaul Holzinger:  Network inspect.\nPaul Holzinger:  So this kind of information your your plugin sees as well. And then you can decide what you want to do. And if you use the - subnet option and stuff, you have the top nets in here like like you are used to, if you Inspect, the normal network, like you have all all the information. And with that, I'm done if there are any questions, please ask them now. Or later.\nDaniel Walsh: You see people modifying CNI plugins to work with us? The goal.\nPaul Holzinger:  That's that's the goal. So because we are gonna deprecate, CNI at like remove it. At some point, we are going to remove the roof to the support and to have a way for some people who are currently having their own custom work. They need to Adapt to to this new one or use a standard driver or there are many ways to set up network of even without that you can use a custom network namespace path. But with this it's pretty simple because the setup and teardown is is built into portman right in into the container life cycle with all having to manage anything as\nPaul Holzinger:  and advantage to the scene icon and instead I integrated the support into Portman network Create as well. So you know we've seen eye plugins custom stuff, you need to manage your CONFIGS on there and place it in the right direction. With that, you're just network create and\nPaul Holzinger:  Hey, Google.\nDaniel Walsh: Very nice.\nTom Sweeney: Any other questions?\nTom Sweeney: Right, thanks Paul. Look great. Ashley Potman Machine West, demo\nAshley Cui: Yeah, I'm gonna share my screen. I demo this already and the container plumbing days but I'm going to show it again for those who aren't that conference but basically we have a new command in podmachine called Padme Machine OS, apply or It's a suite of commands applies. The only one in there at the current moment but what it allows you to do is Ontrador Cora Space Systems which is the default OS for Padre, Machine on Mac and Linux it allows you to take a container image and\nAshley Cui: Add packages based on or build a container image from like a container file and an ad packages into your VM, through rpmos tree,\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Off.\nAshley Cui: which is the package manager for Fedora chorus. So I'm just going to play my demo over here. So I'm going to start a\u2026\n00:10:00\nTom Sweeney:  because,\nAshley Cui: where I'm going to make a new podman machine and parts of these. Are sped up for four times sake but it's all like yeah. Anyway,\nAshley Cui:  And then I'm going to start the machine that I just created so this is just like kind of your vanilla machine. Nothing special inside of it, just your default pond machine. And then, so I'm going to check the podman version and outside the machine. Is the server is, or the server inside the machine is 441, and then the client outside the machine is 4.5. And then. So now I have this container file, it's kind of a standard container file from, but it has Fedora Cross as the base image and what what I'm doing is I'm running rpmos tree and updating containers or podman and it's friends to the most latest upstream version on main and also removing a bunch of stuff. um, and so I'm going to use this container file and build an image.\nAshley Cui:  And also tag it correctly. I assume\nAshley Cui:  and then, so it's gonna this is just a standard podman build like there's nothing special in a regular podium builds command\nAshley Cui:  And so now we have this image that we just built. in our, Local storage.\nAshley Cui:  And then again, checking the cloud inversion inside the VM, it's 441 outside, it's 4.5. And now I'm going to do a pod machine osupply to the and specify the image that I just built and it should apply it to the default POD machine. You can use if your pottery machine is, you know, name something else. You can use that as a second argument and it will apply it to that machine. And then I for Is to take effect, you have to reboot your machine.\nAshley Cui:  And then now if you take a look at diversion inside of the VM, the pod machine, it's upgraded to 4.5 dev so you can see. So this feature is like particularly useful for people who want to experiment with different packages and versions of podium inside the the pod inside the machine. So I guess like For example, like the desktop team uses this or can use this if they want the latest upstream version of podman inside of their pod machine to like, tests and stuff. And again like it allows users to customize the machine in a familiar way so you don't have to go and build new VMs and learn like VM tooling you can you can use what you know which is like container files and building images in order to customize and put whatever you need inside of the VM.\nAshley Cui:  By by just building images and using problems, you know, a supply. So that's that's basically the demo if anybody has any questions.\nDaniel Walsh: Showed you updated from container storage inside of the machine. That was So could it could I call could I do that with a registry?\nAshley Cui: Yes.\nAshley Cui: Yes. So it supports anything that like podcast supports it, anything that like Scopia supports, you can pull it from a registry, you can pull it from local. You can do a bunch of stuff. Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh:  So if I if I was a company I wanted to do this I could push to a right. I could push it update to a registry and then every one of my users on all the different machines automatically. Do they have do that machine update from a registry and everybody would get the same version. Correct.\nAshley Cui:  Yes, absolutely. Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: Cool.\nBrent Baude: I'll just add that. I think there were two use cases in mind. When we went through this design, and Ashley showed the one where we can run the Latest pod man inside the machine, which is great for development and testing. The other one we've had in in mind is the folks that are wanting to do various multi-arch, or non-native arts. Builds or runs or testing, where they need some commute package to be on there. Which does not come as a default. So this is a easy way to plop those on real quick and be able to do whatever it is. You you had in mind.\n00:15:00\nDaniel Walsh: so, two weeks from now with new Core or West comes out. And gets updated what happens? Then\nBrent Baude: What?\nDaniel Walsh: We have to rerun the apply is. Rebuilt with rebuild. And then do we really apply, right?\nBrent Baude: Are you wanting to revert or\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: now, I'm just saying so I've added I guess there's an example.\nBrent Baude: do you want to get done?\nDaniel Walsh: There's a question out on One of the issues, someone wanted installed QM user. You know, that's 390 and\u2026\nBrent Baude:  Yep.\nDaniel Walsh: so they install it, they go through this procedure, they install it. And we're running for OS 37 and 37.1 comes out. Now they want to update,\u2026\nBrent Baude:  Sure.\nDaniel Walsh: they're gonna have to go through this procedure again to\nBrent Baude: If they no longer require the 390 packages, they could just simply take, take the update. or they could just execute a rebuild, which would in the container file would have from you\u2026\nDaniel Walsh:  Okay.\nBrent Baude: with latest which would mean the new version that the door chorus just made, so then A simple rebuild would be enough to do it and and ideally users would be doing a stop of CI. Type things or off of github actions. Where if a repo changes, it would just automatically build and that way they consume, and then it wouldn't be on the user's shoulders to do that manual. Work.\nMatt Heon: Question. If I were to decide to switch back from my custom OS supply, to say Standard F cost, the stable train, does that put me back on automatic updates or am I going to have to do something to get back on automatically updating?\nAshley Cui: So I'm working on the current OS revert. The way that it works right now is it should I put you back on automatic updates? Because I think the automatic update driver is called like Syncotti and that if it detects that you're on a regular stream of fedora, then it should automatically update from what I've seen. Not 100% sure, but from my testing, but it just depends on like what your base was before I believe.\nTom Sweeney: Any other questions for Ashley?\nBrent Baude: This is going to end when you the one of the things that takes a little getting used to here is we'd very much have had a feeder in Fedora chorus. But now this pivot you have to think of your OS as a container image. And then those all those things we've learned about being an image, maintenance applies,\nTom Sweeney: Pretty. I'm hearing anything else at this point, so I think I'm going to turn it over to Matt for the podman database update.\nMatt Heon: All right, so this is in updates on some internal things on podman that you should not have to care about but unfortunately, you may have to with the coming future. Uh, so podman has a back-end database and if you're just upon an user not developer you probably have no knowledge of this because it's used purely for internal things. We used to store the state of containers and figuration containers, things like that. Um and this was previously in something called Bolt DB, which is a native glen better database, very simple and we thought that it did everything we needed. However, over the last year, so we've become aware of an increasing number of reports of data corruption with both dB to the poor. I wouldn't call it common, but if you are to shut your computer down on expectantly, while Bolt is doing something, there is apparently a fairly good chance that you're going to end up with an unusual database.\n00:20:00\nMatt Heon:  Which means all your containers are gone, basically, requires complete recreate. So we've been looking into this for a while now and we came to the conclusion that it was not really safe to continue using Bull TB. It was unmaintained, there was basically no error handling. There was no path to data recovery and it didn't seem like it would be reasonably possible to create or to fix it rather. So that it did not corrupt itself. So we have investigated alternative database solutions and we now have an alternative database driver written up that uses SQLite instead. So right now, this is just gonna be a tech preview thing that is going to come out with the next partner and release Pod Man. Four, five of the next couple weeks and it's not going to be default for now it's just for people who want to opt into testing it at some point in the future. Probably Paul man for six we're going to see about making it the default for new installations.\nMatt Heon:  existing insulations, will continue to use both DB And at some point in the further off future, we will investigate removing multi-b completely. And basically, having only SQLite and again, primary things you can expect from this transition. One stability Pod, man will stop eating its own database in cases of unexpected power loss. That's obviously, plus two performance in some operations, especially read operations. If you have large wise of containers and you're doing something like a podman PS, you can expect a significant performance boost. And three long term stability, we feel that SQLite has a much more vibrant and large community than volt dB does and as such there's a lot more potential future growth there in terms of performance, in terms of stability.\nMatt Heon:  Potentially features but we're probably not using those. It's going to be a very simple database driver still. So generally speaking, you probably should not have to care about this for this foreseeable future, but at some point in the future, we are going to be announcing a the deprecation and removable DB And when we do that, we will have steps for you to take to get on the new SQLite driver if you haven't already and you probably won't have to. Because again, new installations will be switched over to SQLite. Won't before that And that is a general summary of what to expect with our move to seek lights. Why we're doing it? What to expect\nTom Sweeney: like,\nMatt Heon: Any questions?\nTom Sweeney:  Very quiet bunch today.\nTom Sweeney: Right, I'm not hearing any questions for that. So I think we'll do is go on to the open form and questions that just ask. Are there any general questions or comments that you want to make?\nDaniel Walsh: I'll guess I'll ask a question that I potentially know the answer to One is pardman Ford, our five coming out.\nMatt Heon: Ideally next week late next week, we have rc1 just came out yesterday.\nTom Sweeney: Five.\nMatt Heon: I'm expecting an rc2 later this week potentially an rc3 early. Next week. If we feel, we need it and then a final late next week.\nDaniel Walsh: Okay, and I guess the other question would be what versions are gonna be showing up in the next version of Rella?\nMatt Heon: What are five will not be one of those. We're expecting our next major. Drop into Rel /. Centos stream is going to be for six, which will probably be more of a late summer type of time frame.\nDaniel Walsh: So, I, I would follow that. So right now, apartment 4.4 that one, I think, is that, right? Tom is gonna be in real 902 in Raleigh.8.\nDaniel Walsh:  As I asked loaded questions.\n00:25:00\nMatt Heon: Yeah, we're expecting a 4.6 in nine three and eight nine, I believe. And yeah. Generally speaking, we're going to continue on the same sort of cadence, we had before retargeting for ish, releases per year pot man. And two of those will end up in Ralph from here on out.\nTom Sweeney: And whatever. It's worth the 441, which will be in podman 8892 will be released. sometime in early May\nTom Sweeney:  and then the fourth sixth version will be able to sometime in January. I want to say no February. Getting dates.\nDaniel Walsh: Hey.\nTom Sweeney:  Yeah, did somebody popping? but the question,\nTom Sweeney:  Or comment.\nTom Sweeney:  Okay. Also, while we're here, anybody have any Topics Suggestions For the next meeting in June 6, we have one for a quadlet demo already.\nMatt Heon: Will probe that would not be a bad time to show off podman 4-5. We're still firming some things up right now. So we couldn't really don't want today but we should have a good summary of what's in four or five by the next meeting.\nTom Sweeney: But anybody else or any other questions otherwise we're going to quite a bit early today but that's not a bad thing.\nTom Sweeney:  Okay, then we'll just I'll just remind for the next meetings. We are having a meeting on Tuesday, June 6th for the Quad Man community meeting which again is the demo, kind of meetings, and our next cabal meeting for the community will be on Thursday, April 20th, which is two weeks from this Thursday, I believe. And those meetings are used mostly for design. Kind of work for plugin or any technical discussions related to the to the code base. Pretty much. And we're always happy to have comments or suggestions or topics for other. One of those, please be afraid to send me an email directly or put stuff up in the discuss discussion forums that we have on Github for providing. And unless anybody has anything else I'm going to End the recording.\nTom Sweeney: Okay, recordings done. Anybody wants anything off offline other than Hi? Jake. Good to see you again.\nJake Correnti: Everyone's good to see you.\nDaniel Walsh: Hey, Jake. And yeah at that time Tom I probably do a QM, the qmse Linux thing that I've done internally so I can do that for the next. To explain how we're using Quad LED Auto.\nTom Sweeney:  For the next demo or for the community meeting. Okay.\nDaniel Walsh:  Yeah. Next next community meeting\nTom Sweeney:  That.\nDaniel Walsh:  and hopefully, we can get an update from five main desktop at that point since they'll be just about to go 1.0 What's the date of that?\nTom Sweeney:  Not know, actually, do you know?\nAshley Cui: Many 22nd.\nDaniel Walsh:  What's the date of the next cabal? I mean, the next Emma.\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, well, the next ball is April 20th. The next community meeting is June 6th.\nDaniel Walsh:  Yeah, so we could have them fell just release 1.0 so he probably should have them back into a demonstration.\nTom Sweeney:  I'll check with stuff on.\nTom Sweeney: Right. I'm gonna Close up the meeting. I'm not hearing anything else, folks. Enjoy your lunch dinner breakfast. Whatever. Take care.\nEd Santiago Munoz: Let's work everybody.\nMohan Boddu: Thank you.\nMeeting ended after 00:30:00 \ud83d\udc4b\n")))}pa.isMDXComponent=!0;const ga={},ya="Podman Community Meeting",wa=[{value:"February 2, 2021 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-5)",id:"february-2-2021-1100-am-eastern-utc-5",level:2},{value:"Attendees (49 total)",id:"attendees-49-total",level:3},{value:"Meeting Start: 11:03 a.m.",id:"meeting-start-1103-am",level:2},{value:"BlueJeans Recording",id:"bluejeans-recording",level:3},{value:"Podman v3.0 Overview",id:"podman-v30-overview",level:2},{value:"Matt Heon",id:"matt-heon",level:3},{value:"(1:50 in the video)",id:"150-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Breaking changes.",id:"breaking-changes",level:4},{value:"Demo",id:"demo",level:4},{value:"Podman with Docker Compose Demo",id:"podman-with-docker-compose-demo",level:2},{value:"Brent Baude",id:"brent-baude",level:3},{value:"(11:20 in the video)",id:"1120-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Misc Demos",id:"misc-demos",level:2},{value:"Tom Sweeney",id:"tom-sweeney",level:3},{value:"(18:10 in the video)",id:"1810-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"GitHub Discussions",id:"github-discussions",level:2},{value:"Questions?",id:"questions",level:2},{value:"(24:50 in the video)",id:"2450-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Topics for Next Meeting",id:"topics-for-next-meeting",level:2},{value:"Next Meeting: Tuesday March 2, 2021, 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-5)",id:"next-meeting-tuesday-march-2-2021-1100-am-eastern-utc-5",level:2},{value:"Meeting End: 11:51 a.m. Eastern (UTC-5)",id:"meeting-end-1151-am-eastern-utc-5",level:3},{value:"BlueJeans Chat copy/paste:",id:"bluejeans-chat-copypaste",level:2}],fa={toc:wa},ka="wrapper";function ba(e){let{components:t,...n}=e;return(0,Ne.kt)(ka,(0,ce.Z)({},fa,n,{components:t,mdxType:"MDXLayout"}),(0,Ne.kt)("h1",{id:"podman-community-meeting"},"Podman Community Meeting"),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"february-2-2021-1100-am-eastern-utc-5"},"February 2, 2021 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-5)"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"attendees-49-total"},"Attendees (49 total)"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Tom Sweeney, Brent Baude, Jhon Honce, Dan Walsh, Chris Evich, Lokesh Mandvekar, Urvashi Mohnani, Nalin Dahyabhai, Eduardo Santiago, Valentin Rothberg, Giuseppe Scrivano, Miloslav Trmac, Parker Van Roy, Preethi Thomas, JJ Asghar, Hendrik Haddorp, Dan Walsh, Eric The IT Guy, Ashley Cui, Greg Shomo, Lee Whitty, Anders Bj\xf6rklund, Jacob Lindgren, Christian Felder, Alex Litvak, Paul Holzinger, Rodrique Heron"),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"meeting-start-1103-am"},"Meeting Start: 11:03 a.m."),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"bluejeans-recording"},"BlueJeans ",(0,Ne.kt)("a",{parentName:"h3",href:"https://bluejeans.com/s/UNt8jSU7IH2"},"Recording")),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"podman-v30-overview"},"Podman v3.0 Overview"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"matt-heon"},"Matt Heon"),(0,Ne.kt)("h4",{id:"150-in-the-video"},"(1:50 in the video)"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Podman 3.0 will be the largest ever.

We usually talk about design issues or thoughts for Pod, man. And today we have a good slate of stuff for Pod Man, 50 features, which is coming up. Container essay, and then also talk about Bug Week. So We have a hack MD going, I've put a link into the comments here for Google meet. Please go ahead and add your comments since there is we go along or if I'm going to try and take notes and if I mess up, please go ahead and correct me or add links as appropriate. So giving all that I have Dan walshill first with possible pod, man, 5 features and\nDaniel Walsh: Okay, can you put up the\nDaniel Walsh: You put up the feet, the slide or\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: whatever. thing, everybody slides, shining it shining into\nDaniel Walsh: Okay. so, I view Major releases in two ways, and balance is going to be pushing back on this. So it could get entertainment entertaining a little bit. I view a major release as being A milestone of marketing more than just being, you know, having it like In the real world when relate. Well, nine well-10 comes out. It's not only a chance to say we have new functionality but it's also a chance for marketing. You know, isn't it great that we move this far ahead? So I'd like to, you know, over the years when we had different versions of Pod Man, Come Out. It was not only we didn't do it just for breaking changes but we also did it so much from marketing. So I think with podman 2 came out, we added\nDaniel Walsh:  We moved. I think we that was the first time we added in the new API and FOD, Man, 3 came out. We added appointment, three came out, we had a new API and pod, man. 4 came out, We added, You know, some of the pipe, my machine functionality and other things like that. So when we look at now, it's been well. This is probably planned for the end of the year early next year. So it's gonna be two years since Pod, Man Full came out at that point. So the question I have is what, what did the long-range things that we'd like to see in a marketing event for five man. Five on a second thing is, is when we come up with the major release, it gives us a chance to change the defaults in such a way that potentially, they could break break people. And obviously that's something that we want to avoid.\nDaniel Walsh:  If at all possible but sometimes it's it's necessary in order to move forward. So things I threw down for ideas for podman 5 and again, these don't have to wait for apartment five. They're just major things that are going on in the Pod, Man world right now.\nDaniel Walsh:  That I I see moving forward and I just threw down a few ideas right now this for those. That don't know, there is a pod man, internal database right now is based on multi B and it's felt by the maintainers of the database that it was important to force to support ability. We saw a lot of corruptions happening and multi B and we felt that the upstream for both DB was not as responsive or not as active as we'd like. And so we wanted to switch to something a little more stable which was ask you a light. And so that's actually in Part-man 405 right now, you can actually test With.\nDaniel Walsh:  SQLite. But I'm at apartment 5, we'd switch. The default to SQL Light. Obviously upgrades would continue in both DB, but if you did a restart reset, then you switched SQLite There's also a big effort for the lots and lots of uses on Windows cannot support.\nDaniel Walsh:  Wsl. Usually it's something inside the company that says, they don't like wsl or whatever reason it is and they've asked us to support five main machine for Native virtualization. So on Windows, the first version of that is going to be Hyper-V, which is being heavily worked on right now. When Brent is there? Is that available at all right? Now for testing\n00:05:00\nBrent Baude: It's actually done.\nBrent Baude:  There's some official stuff that needs to go into fossa and ignition. But and some nits to smooth over in podman. but, Yeah, you just need the secret decoder ring. For me to get the image.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah. And I don't I mean again this you know probably obviously is going to come out probably in four six might be you know just you won't need the Dakota ring to turn it on at that point or but it's it's something that we want to again market that we have new architecture. Just are not new virtualization support.\nBrent Baude: Yep.\nDaniel Walsh:  Secondarily to that is on the max right now. We support qemu for running our podman machines. And there's been a lot of requests for sporting that native virtualization. Mac apples actually, making it much more attractive or\nDaniel Walsh:  Making c** you much less attractive as a solution based on some of this stuff they're doing for support of multi-atch building. So that's sort of driving us towards native virtualization Plus, we believe that we can get better performance by using Verdeo of SD instead of playing nine for volume mounting into the containers. This is something the darker currently supports. So we will be doing some time in the next six months or so we moving, or adding support for native Mac. Virtualization anything you want to say on that Brent.\nBrent Baude: Started working on it today, hope to have it done for four six.\nDaniel Walsh: Okay. The next one is, now we start to get into system controvers. So, not only three above would necessarily be breaking changes.\nDaniel Walsh:  The next one would be potentially more controversial, which would be to drop CNI support right now. We if you run containers, With pod man. The default that you get on a fresh installed pod, man is neta back for networking stack. We currently also continue to support CNI, but the idea would be, Can we get rid of the CNI code? Can we get rid of the support headache of CNI? And really, this to me, is more guided towards a real 10 type release thing and that\nDaniel Walsh:  when we sign up for new version of podman releases on a particular rail, we're signing up for 10 years of support. So the question is, Do we want to support? CNI 12 years from now on top of Pod, Man. Now, obviously, we can never break. We can't break REL support on Level Eight Row 9. So CNI support. But can we start to get rid of it by default? and I think that, Mainly for people on here that ends up being somewhat of a time sink. For a matte and Paul.\nDaniel Walsh:  Hopefully would start to disappear as we move forward and more people use it, but it would clean up the code base to get rid of C and I altogether out of it. Any comments by Matt Paul on that.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, I mean the one benefit also of saying we're dropping CNI is that it can convince people to switch over to Netovac easier than feeling like they're gonna get it supported for? Forever.\nMartin Jackson: That.\nMartin Jackson:  There.\nDaniel Walsh:  The next one is also similar and probably more to me, more important. Is that we right now, I believe system D is about to drop support for C groups, V1, Um, so that I think, I don't know if it's Fedora 38, if there are 39 is no longer going to support sea Groups, B to be one. So can we start to look at dropping support for cigarettes for you, one for our tool chain. So I think the primary tool there would be like Seron and run c start to think about it as well as I'm not sure how much We do in Pod man for that, but it's probably they're certain flags. That would have to be start to be removed since then. All I can make sense in the cedar must be two worlds. Um, and again, I think that's just for long range support. right now, from a rel,\n00:10:00\nDaniel Walsh:  point of view around 9:00 defaults to see groups V2 relate on the single three one but rallied is going into\nDaniel Walsh:  Support mode. I think, either, I think in either the next release of the one after is going to be in full support mode so that We shouldn't be. Adding new features to see them to be one or in that dying out. Anybody want to comment on that?\nBrent Baude: I do proposed timing. of the podman 5, I think would have A big influence on that particular topic. I actually really like this idea.\nBrent Baude:  There's some distribution benefits to this.\nBrent Baude:  But I think one of the things we'll have to do is if we did it today, we'd be cutting off. The two lts's of Ubuntu, right? Is that correct? Is a mantu gone to see groups, we too. They might happen to know.\nChristopher Evich: I think the latest one is.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: I think 22.\nBrent Baude: Okay. Yeah, so it's just something to contemplate as Who we lose? If we do that and but otherwise, I'm completely comfortable with this.\nChristopher Evich: But the old ubuntu's, the old lts a bunches, they just won't update. Right. They they're going to just keep running the older apartment. Should.\nBrent Baude: Yeah, it was sort being unaware that their V2 now so is our V2 lts.\nValentin Rothberg: No.\nBrent Baude: That's what we need.\nValentin Rothberg: I also think that who's is using V1 still. So, if we Cut, or if we would drop.\nDaniel Walsh: Christopher.\nMartin Jackson: A lot of Chromebook users are on old Debians\u2026\nBrent Baude: So, maybe\nMartin Jackson: because of the Chromebook Chromebook default virtualization scheme and I think they might be stuck to.\nBrent Baude:  So, Dan sounds like, maybe we need to Kind of understand what everyone else is V2 plans. Sort of look like But again. we could theoretically, just Do it and\nBrent Baude:  deal with the consequences.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nPaul Holzinger: I one question.\nDaniel Walsh: so,\nPaul Holzinger: how much C group code is actually important because isn't most of it done by the runtimes,\nMatt Heon: There's a fair bit of complexity involved in how we do system unit container and how we do the Pod C groups in particular Pod, resource limits involve a fair bit of, super one for C2 last, I checked those would be the big ones. I would say. It's not a huge amount of code, but it is, it is some of the most complicated code. If you've ever seen the code to set up our potsy groups, It's a horrifying massive. If statements\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nBrent Baude: I like the idea. I'd sure like to keep kicking it around.\nDaniel Walsh: So the next one will get even more controversial, which is so we've been kicking around this idea of moving away from Jesus image format. to Zstd both have been supported for several years and\nMartin Jackson: it's\nDaniel Walsh:  The spec. but, Docker did not release for over three years. So, Giuseppe had a pull request into Docker. Back in 2002 and that finally got merged and they released a version with it. In March. so, they had him released from March of twenty two, thousands of my 2023. The.\n00:15:00\nDaniel Walsh:  We have women kicking around the idea of supporting what we've currently support both zsdd. And Jesus format for images. And it's been supported for many years. In Container D, Cryo and the rest of the world other than darker, And it's been in pod man. For I think every version of pod man, all the way back to one dot six. Maybe not 106. So which is or else seven?\nDaniel Walsh:  The problem is that no one creates images with this format because Of Docker, not being able to support the older versions of darker, not being able to support it. we have ideas about potentially, Allowing you users to Check Pick which format they want to basically in containers duck off, pick which formats, that they want to push images to container registry with, and the options would be zstd gzip or a combination of both. So they could basically have but use it within have to pay the price of Pushing two versions of images to container registries and container registries, that would have to store.\nDaniel Walsh:  Two versions of the same image. One compressed with each one of them and pod, man, and tools, based on Containers image would be smart enough to pick out the zestd one. If it existed. So, the benefits of their cost and benefits. And we stick with Gzip, we're stuck with the same format that we've been using for years, but old dark versions of darker support it And they can continue to use it. If we force everybody to go to Zstd then old versions of dark are don't support it but everybody in\nDaniel Walsh:  The new versions of Pod Man. Not new versions of darker and all versions of our tool change. Get the benefits of better, better compression Quicker downloads in the case of Pod Man and Cryo and those tools they get you weight Grow quicker downloads since it's the pulling down individual files instead of entire images just a different false at a difference. The third option that combination of both has the Problem of you would have to if you're paying for the bandwidth of pushing images that you'd have to pay for additionals, content being pushed, as well as if you're paying for the cost of storing of images. Then you have to pay for both and we potentially could hear bad things from container. Registries who don't want, you know, who are paying the content paying to store both types of content. So,\nDaniel Walsh:  the my proposal for Ralph's, for\nDaniel Walsh: Five would be to, we just switch the default to ZSTD thinking that to be a large enough install base of of dockers out there at that point and for people who don't want to use it, they could just simply change the containers that cost to point to Jesus want to to do both. And, but my fear is that we don't do this then. When Pod Man 6 comes up three years from now we're still going to be having this this debate. So you know can we push this forward?\nMatt Heon: I think risk here is a lot lower than the CNI. And what do you call it secrets? We want stuff because we're not dropping code.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah. Also distributions can, if distributors want to ship a Canadian stock off, that stays the Gzip, then they have the full ability to do it, This just questioning what should be the default format? We go forward with at that point.\nDaniel Walsh:  Any other comments?\nBrent Baude: Yeah. How does it? How does it work? In terms of you, you mentioned push but in terms of run or other actions, if, if the STD is the default, Are we saying, can you have a local container storage that has both formats?\nDaniel Walsh: So it's only I'm push and pull. So when it, when it gets put on to your desk, you don't have the format any longer. The big think of this is more pushing and\u2026\nBrent Baude:  Okay.\nDaniel Walsh: this is the problem is if you've tried to pull one these images with an older version of Docker, you will fail. It'll come back with that saying,\u2026\n00:20:00\nBrent Baude:  Okay, but\nDaniel Walsh: unsupported format.\nBrent Baude: But I think what you're saying is, there's, you know, both formats would still be perfectly usable. It's just be a swap.\nDaniel Walsh: Yes. Which means\u2026\nBrent Baude: So if container registries didn't\nDaniel Walsh: if I meant stats to push images, that can't be used by older versions of darker. That's that's with the dot, that's where we're gonna get. We're gonna get paid as being anti-unity or anti You know. Oci or something at that point.\nBrent Baude: So, I I would, I would be in favor of this. The one thing I would want some sort of commitment from Let's say somebody like Cui. That they would be there be a way to build. Zstd. On their end.\nBrent Baude:  because, A lot of us. Use. Combinations of GITHUB and CUI. And auto building.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nBrent Baude:  and one one, like one image, I can think of in particular is Fedora chorus has a\nBrent Baude:  They have a image they use for building for coros. And that image is updated weekly. And it's four and a half gig. But I believe it's built, you know, hands off. So it'd be one of those. One of my questions would be If we if we switch, that would be, this would be more effective if if more people could take advantage of it,\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, but to me to me that's this is where the check of the egg situation is sort of like the old before we force sea groups, V2. Like Oh no. One support secretly too. Why don't they support it? Because no one uses secret too. So, until we start pushing zsdd images. if you went to Cui and said, You know, will you build with CSD? They're like, well, no one uses the STD so it's sort of\nDaniel Walsh:  yeah.\nValentin Rothberg: The problem with cstd is that it's in contrast to see Group C group. You fail immediately on the client. So the users. While with Csdd, it may be a silent change entirely transparent to the user. But when they pushed their images, some of their clients may break because they're still using older. so the let's say, The the error multiplication happens, much further. And much more transitively than for secret security.\nDaniel Walsh: Right.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah. And I guess so that to follow, I mean, I would argue that we are We did this. When we started supporting OCI because older versions of darker, at the time didn't support OCI images. But at that time, Paul Man was brand new so it wasn't I guess people who would expect it to, Potentially cause more breakage than it would now.\nValentin Rothberg: But also, any any breakage can be negative marketing as well. As much as any major major version. I personally perceive major version bumps as all yet, another breaking change.\nDaniel Walsh: So we can't we can hold off on that one that argument to the end. Since that's the\nDaniel Walsh:  I don't see that. I mean potentially we push both but then we're gonna get bad news, you know, by the fall but then we get bad. Press from people saying we're using up twice as much bandwidth twice, as much storage.\nDaniel Walsh: But maybe that's the value one but I don't think it valid one is. Oh, we'll just wait, Yes more before. Does anybody ever use a zdd because You know, at some point in the future, there's gonna be enough docker clients out there that Supporting an old ones and\u2026\nValentin Rothberg: Like, I think it should be a\nDaniel Walsh: I could hear you autos Old Ubuntu is an old. rails and all, well must bad shape, but\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: but I think,\nValentin Rothberg: I think it should be stepwise migration where, you know, since it's a containers, conflict can be configurable. So Fedora can go first and just Change the standard compression in only in Fedora to see standard without this being built-in, default, setting for Portman, which would then affect all other distributions as well. so, I think that there are ways to, you know, increase, The usage and\u2026\n00:25:00\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nValentin Rothberg: the user-based step by step and not use the big hammer and switch or try to switch everybody at the same time. I think in Fedora, you know, this is probably at least in this immediate community an easier. Test that\nDaniel Walsh: It and in the movie that she and the Moby that ship by Fedora supports the format. So it's not if you live in a fedora pure environment, you're not going to be bit by this.\nDaniel Walsh:  So I could go along with that. Just doing his containers.com and leave the standard. Leave it to fall to the STD for built into package, config into common. Yeah.\nBrent Baude: Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh:  Okay.\nDaniel Walsh:  I guess. Those that on the call right now, the next one is the concept of the build farm. And nalin. Did a demo of this? I don't know if that was an internal or external. a few weeks ago, the basic idea is as We're hearing more and more people who want to build. Images for multiple formats. So from multiple architectures, And a lot of people, it's a fairly complex. Tooling of fairly complex effort to build image for multiple architectures, especially if you're not building them with some kind of emulation mode. Um, So the the basic idea would be say you're on a Mac. You're saying, I'm too Mac and you're building.\nDaniel Walsh:  I'm chips based images and then you want to build x86 image and you want to push both of those to a registry so that you create a new full buyer image and it's too architectures. While doing that is fairly complex and what? Nowlin is demonstrated with the tool. He called Build Farm was the ability to Do that automatically taking advantage of.\nDaniel Walsh:  Connections. So now on you on the call,\nDaniel Walsh:  Put you on the spot.\nTom Sweeney: Nobody's no way on pidgeot today.\nDaniel Walsh:  That one's away on Pto. Okay? So the the basic idea would be to to you do a pod man. Build - platform equals am AMD, 64 comma. I'm calm or power and what would happen is odd, Man. Built Odd, Man client would look through its connection database to see if it has connections to the different architectures and then would launch the bills on the different architectures. So say you had set up three ssh connections to build service to be able to perform the builds on a remote system. Then it would pull the images back to the local system create a manifest list and actually assembly entire image and push it out to a registry. So it wouldn't be you wouldn't have to deal with manifest. You wouldn't have to deal with\nDaniel Walsh:  Any any special needs for running multiple, you're sitting on a Mac and two and you had two VMs running two podium machines running one for X86 and one for on then if you build with a - platform I'm an x86 they would go out and to the two different VMs on the local Mac and would build the images and then reassemble them back on the default one and then push that to a registry. So that's what we're looking at for podman, builds farm support. And again, it's not looking at emulation mode. This is looking to build natively or On a native VM running an emulation mode, but as opposed then other basically allowing us to fully assemble those on it.\nDaniel Walsh:  Any questions on that?\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: and I think that Bill Kit is doing this and I think the killer feature for Kubernetes was Windows containers, being able to build those remotely Because most of the Linux ones could be cross-compiled but not windows.\nDaniel Walsh: The problem across compilation, is, as well as twofold one, it's low, and it's potentially very buggy. I know that in the real world, Well, if you refuses to support cross compilation because it's just not this exact same as native. Now, certain architects, if you're building golang code, it's not as big a problem, but if you're building standard seat code, just to see libraries, I just felt to be way too risky to to support cross country.\n00:30:00\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: no, the equipment, this one was gold coat and I mean, and also You couldn't do workarounds if there was some across compilation issues but it's still a good feature. Of course, to be able to have remote bare metal, builders for performance reasons.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, yeah. And I'm like having what we're looking at here, Actually more of the client driven solution, then the server driven solutions so that you would just have to set up two two and more connection databases to different architectures and either run that VMs locally or remotely. It's just taking advantage of what basically what Pod man remote currently does to assemble these? I think build kid is more on the service side, so you'd have to have, you know, rely on a server. Being set up to do the multiatch builds. Um so anyways it's something that we'd like to get to match the functionality. That's in build kit now but take advantage of what we have with. Basically, the connection database empowerment.\nDaniel Walsh: So the next one, someone else put in.\nBrent Baude: Yeah, I can do that final comment.\nDaniel Walsh: So I'm gonna let that Yeah, you run the bathroom. All right, I'll be back.\nBrent Baude: Yep, final comment on the bit on that build farm though is I think there's a I've no objection with the feature. That's it's a good feature. I think also though there's A a couple of nuggets of gold on the topic of Cross architecture. Period. Throughout Potman.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: and I think also now that build decks gone default that has kind of upped the competition if you\nBrent Baude:  Yeah. So as I think about Batman Moore as a whole, I think there are several areas where architecture plays a role and\nBrent Baude: but, Starting with. My gripe about being able to pull the wrong architecture. And attempt to execute it.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: It. Yeah but I mean there are some nice things like being able to use Kubernetes pod builders and stuff like that, that this could be a nice features to have also important.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund:  I mean, with, with a root, let's capabilities and everything. You have a You have a whole dockering doctor, a customer to migrate. I think the life. Of course.\nBrent Baude: Indeed. Okay, so Timewise here. I'll try to be efficient. the first one was,\nBrent Baude:  After that, apple hypervisor stuff is done.\nBrent Baude:  Someone probably not me needs to sit down. and contemplate a refactoring of machine code, there's Plenty of duplication that can be removed. I think there's there's a couple of changes in how we do things that could be. Implemented such as factory or build type patterns.\nBrent Baude:  And things along those lines. Again, that's not really a feature, it's not something that users would know about. So it could be It could be set as a goal for V5. Or it could just be done in four dot whatever. And no one be the wiser.\nDaniel Walsh: Fall. Yeah, On similar we have discussed potentially moving part man. Machine out of podman into it, separate repository whether we want to or not people are using pottery machine for uses other than just pod man. and so, it potentially could get if we moved it to a separate repo, then potentially you get more people to coming work on it as a separate project. So there are, there are thoughts going around that.\nBrent Baude: Agreed. I've been sort of asking questions around the team as many of them all know as to whether we should start. Making manifest lists more, integral to podman. So to me that's an open question. But but Dan wanted? wanted edge, sort of ideas that You know, are gonna push things a little bit and This might be one of those again, it involves. some compatibility issues as well as registry things, but I wonder if it's something we should start doing.\n00:35:00\nDaniel Walsh: Yep, for those that don't know when you pull an image right now. To a system by default. We don't have a minute. We don't necessarily pull down and manifest list with the difference between an image in a manifest list. Is that If you have a multi-atch image then you have a manifest list of defines the different arches that are in the image by default. Right? Now a very common era that we hit is people pull down a different architectures image. That becomes a default image and then if you go to run at image layer, say, Pull down Alpine for For arm and you're an x86-64. Now you go run the command. Just do a pod Man. Run commander later and you think that you're gonna re-pull a\nDaniel Walsh:  X86 image and run that no you end up running the command on top of the image that you pull down. If we had a manifest list, then we could change the behavior so that if you did Pull an image for different architecture. You would get put into the manifest list, if you rent to run it and we could run the native, We pull the native one down or just have the native one available so moving to a manifest list by default again.\nDaniel Walsh:  Because the world's moved pretty much when darker happened and over the last first, say eight years of container worlds. It was one architecture x86 with, you know, a tiny bit of different architectures in the world and I think over the because of what Apple has done and the rise of arm. Now we're seeing that there's two architectures out there you know better and you know if risky happens or there could be three architectures and so suddenly we'll work living in a world with Supporting multi arch should be the default as opposed to this one often. And that's what that's why I would like to see us move to manifest list as by default.\nBrent Baude: I think the last time that we talked about this, we sort of came to the conclusion that what we'd be talking about here is in rather than an opt-in. This would be an opt out. So that would be the big change is that we would just turn it on. And allow users to opt out of it. As a way to start. Getting people to use it. Kind of like SC Linux.\nBrent Baude:  Anything anyone want to comment on this one or honesty, Linux?\nMatt Heon: How seriously is this going to Sorry?\nPaul Holzinger: I can.\nMatt Heon: Go go Ed.\nPaul Holzinger: No, I, I totally support the idea of having manifests because I never understood the current behavior that you just used to take from your native image and then all of the sudden, it's Like no use, I can understand what's happening here. So I I think that that makes much more sense.\nBrent Baude: I don't think they need to understand it either or should have to\nPaul Holzinger: It right, right? That's the thing. Like the current behavior never made sense to me. So,\nBrent Baude: Go ahead, Matt.\nMatt Heon: How seriously is this going to affect? Like I don't think we can change the way. Say Odd man Inspects works on images. Is this going to seriously affect my workflow? If I'm used to only using podman and spec podman history, all the image specific commands. My concern would be that suddenly I start getting different output because it's a manifest list, not an image and\nDaniel Walsh: I think it would just default to the unaid about this would allow us, I believe to always default to the native arch. So if you do a pod,\u2026\nBrent Baude: Correct.\nDaniel Walsh: man, if you do a pod man pulled - platform equals, And then you do a pod, man. Inspect Image. Without the dash dash equals it. You'd get the native format one as opposed to the one.\nMatt Heon: Okay. Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: That's the goal and\u2026\nMatt Heon: I'm sure.\nDaniel Walsh: I'm making up since we haven't done this and I haven't experimented with it but that was that's the goal.\nBrent Baude: These are just ideas.\nMatt Heon: We're going to blow something up. We're going to make someone very angry because all of a sudden, they're making manifest list that they didn't know even were a thing. But I don't, I agree.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah. Commitment.\nMatt Heon: That's a good idea and I don't think we can avoid us.\nBrent Baude:  What did you say? We're gonna make users, make manifest lists.\n00:40:00\nDaniel Walsh: Right.\nDaniel Walsh: Those that don't know on this call, manufactless is just a JSON file on this. Yeah.\nBrent Baude: Yeah, and I would suggest that we make every bit of effort to hide that. There's a manifest list from people.\nDaniel Walsh:  Yeah.\nBrent Baude: unless, People know about it and want to alter specifically the manifest list. I think there's a set of rules. We could kind of come up with that, that would allow for that. Okay, we best move on.\nBrent Baude:  The the next one is around this podman machine and the OCI images. This is this is essentially where you can build your own images or we could distribute our images, or epcot's images via something like quick,\nBrent Baude:  This is a pretty big advantage for us. It, it also has a few upsides, one of which I listed there, but\nBrent Baude:  this is, this could be a potentially breaking visible change in the sense that we're changing how pot Padman machine gets its content So that's why I have it kind of associated with five, but I also the same time we'd be using this. My plan was that we would use this to enforce this. That the version of the client, dictates the version of the guest. And so, if you have a Mac and you're using pie man for eight, you're gonna or rather five, oh, you're gonna get a 50. You're gonna get a 50.\nBrent Baude:  Guest operating environment. Inside the machine and if you're at five one, you'll get a five one. This eliminates, our problem of mismatched. Clients and servers so to speak. It's sort of a double whammy.\nDaniel Walsh: it also allows people to lock in, at a specific version, so as we, as we start to go out for\nDaniel Walsh: Enterprise customers. They're going to want to building for. You know. A specific version of the operating system. I want to build on that up that level of the operating system so they can Guarantee that this will work with the podmin for six version of odd men. For instance of say that is five five seven and they want their service are all at five three. Then they can log in and build on a five, three based image.\nBrent Baude: Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: Test.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: And what is the, what is the difference between this and having a URL for the image?\nBrent Baude: It's the the image is, is different on there. So For example. Today, we pull down a few cow for qmu. In and\u2026\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah.\nBrent Baude: so in the future, we would pull down an OCI image.\nBrent Baude: Not a cute girl.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Right. But I mean, if you wanted to fix the version, you could do that by providing a custom image to direct. But this would make it easier to host.\nBrent Baude: Yeah, we're\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: It doesn't.\nBrent Baude: It would, but we're desperately trying to stay out of the developing our own fedora chorus and having to do things outside of what Fedora chorus, the team offers.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: That was just wondering if there was a benefit if you had a Web server serving images. Today, if there was a benefit of moving it to OCI images in a registry instead.\nBrent Baude: And yeah, I don't know. but the tagging of the, you know, the tagging ability there and how image, registries are organized are Quite beneficial.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah, and I guess you don't have to maintain two different types of servers would be. A benefit to some.\nBrent Baude: Something like that. Yep.\nDaniel Walsh: You know.\nChristopher Evich: The city and Cdns aspect. This one.\nDaniel Walsh: Right. We'd like to get to a world where all software shipped fear. Image. It's basically image repositories which Are whether they're coming as containers or operating systems.\n00:45:00\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Or packages. Yeah. Yeah.\nBrent Baude: Okay? And the last one you guys have for those that are on the team, you've heard me kick this topic around recently and it's Probably appropriate for for V5 since it theoretically is a change that users would be impacted by. But essentially right now for running Padman machine depending on the hypervisor and the operating system being used, we have to have various services. running, whether it would be traffic forwarding, whether it would be for vsoc, listening, Whether it might be for Vert. Iowa Fest. And so on.\nBrent Baude:  VF Kit would be another one. so, we've talked about whether we should continue to have these microservices and try to continue to manage them as such or whether we assimilate. Into a single service with Microservices underneath it. So that's an idea.\nDaniel Walsh:  Any comments on any of this, anybody else have ideas of what they would like to see us have in padman 5.\nDaniel Walsh:  Good everybody.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: And dance, some of those storage ideas.\nMartin Jackson: It is.\nDaniel Walsh: Go Anders.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah, so and there was some talk about like IPF storage and similar. I compared to peer storage and so on. I was wondering if any of that is coming to containers image and therefore podman.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: So that you could both split up your your layers into smaller files and then distribute those files. With our peer-to-peer type of registry.\nDaniel Walsh: I guess Valentin or Miller's life, if you thought about that or Giuseppe.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: And also talk on Foster. I might\nMatt Heon: We have none of those people on the call. Dan Unfortunately, Valentin actively early. So I think it's a I think it's a good idea.\nDaniel Walsh: Um, yeah. Yeah, and just The Anders, could we put that in for discussion on the next Meetup? The next one of these, That seems like a decent conversation.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yes.\nDaniel Walsh: I'll also move container shell. To the next discussion for those that don't. I've had two meetings in the last week with different customers who are looking to control users on a service. So the idea would be potentially to allow us to customize their environment. Basically imagine logging into a system, getting stuck into a, A container. And that's what I just calling a container shelf and now, but we don't have time for that. Martin, you get to talk my talk.\nMartin Jackson: Okay, sure. I was wondering, you know, with the, the kind of marketing aspect of the major rep whether Quadlet would get promoted from, you know, kind of experimental tech preview to, you know, fully supported and, and get some more marketing around it.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah yes definitely. Although sometimes we do that that's more of a real thing than a necessarily.\nMartin Jackson:  Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah you know but yeah definitely quadlet would be police fully supported at that time, matter fact, container shell would be Also looking at extending quadlet to allow use users to define quadlets for users. As opposed to quadrant for system services. So that's\nPaul Holzinger: Speaking. And speaking for upstream, I would say Quadlet is fully supported like we five bucks, we fix bucks. People come in with ideas. So\nMartin Jackson: Oh, I'm using the heck out of quadlet and I love it. You know, I I it is it is one of the coolest things to happen in the pod, man, ecosystem, you know, in my mind like ever, I've got it running game servers, I've got it, running my automatic ripping machine and since we're being recorded, I'm not going to incriminate myself, but, you know, I love it.\n00:50:00\nDaniel Walsh: Good. we got no, we've gotten a lot of nice feedback and now now the idea is to get more of the word out to get People blogging people, it's showing, I would love to have people start to distribute quadlets and saying, This is how I run this service underneath, you know, system D. And as we move to a judge devices, I think quadlet is critical.\nMartin Jackson: I I totally agree with that thought.\nDaniel Walsh:  And it's really, really simple. So that's what I think. That's what everybody likes about it.\nDaniel Walsh:  So it's Valentin left. We don't have to so valentin's. I'll I'll be the devil's advocate and make myself Valentin. Now he without you is that we never break anybody, he wants He wanted to talk about\nDaniel Walsh:  Sort of. Leanestabolus's idea that you never break an application by updating the kernel and i we could argue back and forth, obviously don't want to break people but we also don't want to be Carrying old crafty code for forever. So the for me, it's more about pushing the envelope. So, my concern is that when you don't, Break anybody? You end up with the same code that you had in 2012. So for instance, I pushed updates that have broken people to make things more secure, because some the false picked by darker war were bad. So my concern when we say we never break anybody is that we get stuck.\nDaniel Walsh:  You know, just doing stuff the same way as we have for the last 10 years even though they're a better ways like Zstd for storing images and you know, and we have a even secretary too. It's like we get stuck. As he was three one forever. So sort of the Fedora mattress mantra is what I like which is okay. Let's push people to its these these new changes and some people are going to drag drag behind and we try to keep them as happy as possible. But we need to push the the technologies and I think this is partly why Docker was in a relief for three years is because they get stuck in this. And those quandary. So but I agree that both arguments are valid and you know, since a lot of the people in this call are supporting rel for 10 years, we're going to be stuck supporting this stuff for\nDaniel Walsh:  You know many many years but I think we can push the upstream a little bit faster to take advantage of new technologies as they come along.\nMatt Heon: It would be an easier sell if we Publicly maintained long-term support branches of V4 for a longer time. I think our upstream position is that V4 is going to go out of support the very moment that V5 comes out. We do have to support it for REL for a while, but that's not really an upstream thing. So maybe we could formally announce upstream support of some degree for a long-term fee for branch just to keep people. Overall, we do the breaking change v5 thing.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah. But people have to understand that they won't be getting new features. So if on the floor, yeah. Okay,\u2026\nMartin Jackson: I mean I think I think people kind of get that they wouldn't be getting new features with that kind of thing.\nDaniel Walsh: for example.\nMartin Jackson: But In.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: I'm not sure if you seen the Ubuntu support for podman people want a stable version and the latest version at the same time in Debian, stable release. But but I viewed apartments support is not so much kernel, it's more like Python. So you would have Python 2 and I thought that were like Be around forever and then you have a Python 3 that you try to push to people and no one will take it.\nDaniel Walsh:  Right. I know it took it until Fedora basically turned off by then too, right? So\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah. And that in a decade past or something. That's your\nTom Sweeney: And just looking at the clock I'm gonna push a little bit to wrap us up here. Matt that you want to say anything about the demo or on bookfix week before you head out.\nMatt Heon: Sure, I can keep this quick. So the Pod Man Core team is going to be doing a bug week for the next week. Not just the podman team builder and Scorpio and everyone else should be involved as well. But as part of this, we are encouraging. Anyone who wants to fix bugs or have bug fixed, please focus. And let us know that you can see or something high priority or even better. Please comment on a book and say I'd like to work on this next week and we will get it assigned to you or try and get a prioritized. And the goal is to guys make books we can fix over the next week and then do some stability releases week after\n00:55:00\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah. So what we work on the next week will be in five man four or five dot one. This is the goal. To put more.\nMatt Heon: Yeah, we'll do a\nChristopher Evich: It might be might be worth putting that invitation out on the mailing list.\nMatt Heon: Yeah, I can send an email.\nTom Sweeney: Okay, great. That word running out of clocks. So I am going to just announce real quickly that we're having our next meeting on May 18th for the Cabal and then June 6th for the community meeting.

So welcome everybody to the Quad man community the ball meeting. The meeting that we generally talk about future design decisions and topics along those lines. Rather than demos, the demos meetings are generally held during the community meetings, which will be coming up. In June, I think it's June second. We'll talk about that later on today. For today we've four topics lined up. We have talked about container sage being led by Dan and Lokesh, We have another topic about storage allowing lawyers to be split across multiple files and Anders thanks for joining today. I know it's a holiday and all where you're at\n\nTom Sweeney:  And I thank you started at this point and then we'll be talking about Podman.io. We've got some very exciting, new changes going on there and there are more Maureen is going to be talking about and then Dan's gonna be talking about the App Store on the containers project so given all that. Oh and you know put a link to the Hack MD, I'll be taking notes during the meeting today in hackham day. If you have any I think that add that I've messed up or you want to add a link or anything like that. Go ahead, please do it. There. And I'm trying to check on. The moment here. Given all that. I'm going to start it off with general location. I'm not sure who's doing the talk. This one for the container sh Yeah, yes.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, I guess. Who I'm getting feedback.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Are the people getting it? All right, the Echo, one way. So I don't have any presentation on it right now. And Lokesh myself and some people from the SC, Linux team have been working. as a side project on the, an idea, what we calling Pod, Man Shell And what this basically is. Will be an enhancement to podman to allow. you to configure a shell account or login account with a shell of podman shell, which would automatically Inject a user into a. Container, when it lies into the system. So think of it like a hunting pot environment, What we're trying to do is to do it as\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Part of, you know, just a link off of Pod man so it won't be a new executable and that we're all gonna be taking advantage of quadlet to define a user container for that user. So imagine you create a container, a quad that podman Sheldon, quad that\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Not die container. I mean you define which image you want to use it to be injected into what Cgroups you want them to be controlled fine, with what volumes, you want to make available to the user inside of the environment. Then when the user logs onto the system, he would automatically get he or she would automatically get injected into the container and be locked down With that. The container would have any rights that you wanted to expose the user. The reason we, we've had a couple of government type\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Customers that have come in and talked to us about how they would like to be able to use some container technology to actually control uses that allowing into the system. So, you can imagine a, You have a sort of a system with lots and lots of data on it when you, but you want to give a use either a shell account, so he gets onto the system and only able to see certain directories on the system. Another way another idea would be You want to set up sort of more like Toolbox where you would log on to a system and have an entire suite of tools available to you, that will be different than other users logging into the system onto the same system, but have, you know, constant data that you could use to do it?\n\nDaniel Walsh:  So, I think it's a fairly small enhancements to pod to Odd, Man, and most functionality, we found the most of functionalities available. Now in the system, just by using system D to start up a service for the user. And then just basically getting a pyramid exact into the into the show into the container that you're going to create. One issue we're having right now is a timing issue in that. I think there's a bit of a race condition because really what we want to have happen is when the user ssh is into the box, this container gets started. For the session. And then I think, We haven't quite figured out how to wait for the shell. For the container to get up and running before you try to exact into it. So if part Man shell\n\n00:05:00\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Execs in right away. Then the shell might, the container might not be up and running at the time. So it was a race condition, the beauty of using system need to manage these. The actual containerized service is that System D will keep track of all sessions. So if you logged into the system multiple times, Um then system legal maintain the service running until you log out of all sessions and then we kill off the container. So anyways, we've talked internally about this and this is the first time we're really talking about it externally. Does anybody have any questions?\n\nBrent Baude: Dan on the problem of the container starting, that the racy part could you define a basically a bogus Dependent container and\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Yeah.\n\nBrent Baude: weight on that one.\n\nBrent Baude: so, it would be Essentially,\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh: I think.\n\nBrent Baude: you'd wait on what you'd wait on one, but you're really just using it as a indicator for the other.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  well, I think the problem is apartment Shell is gonna I think this I think when you log into the system, Lokesh you, you've experienced this, right? You talk about it.\n\nLokesh Mandvekar: Uh yeah. So what the one thing of notice was if I rerun the setup, I often end up with no such Container image. Sorry no such container.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Right.\n\nLokesh Mandvekar: So And I also see a bunch of SC Linux messages about non-existent keep yourself. So, I'll figure that.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Yeah, and I think what's happening is when you log into the box as you log in System D realizes you're creating a new session. It starts the session then starts the container, but simultaneously at podman cell is running. so, I think what we need to do is to have Quad man, Shelby smart enough to retry for some period of time. you know, basically do a fallback until the container is actually exists. would be the most saying, but only do it for, you know, 10 seconds or something, I don't as we might be something that we have to configure, but\n\nBrent Baude: We do that basically a back-off as well with other stuff\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Right.\n\nBrent Baude: where you know, you try and 250 milliseconds and then 500 and then one second. Yep.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Good. I think I think we do that and then it's a container doesn't start for a certain amount of time then. You know, kill the shell and drop out. I think that. but,\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Any any other comments questions? Thoughts.\n\nBrent Baude: What's the primary? You know, jumping up and down. User.\n\nBrent Baude:  Use case, if you will.\n\nDaniel Walsh: so, the users that first brought this up or were basically, real heavy security people who wanted to A traditional use case for um, these type of customers is that they allow a user to get onto a system that has data, that's at multi-level, so top secret data, secret data, and they want to allow the user to get on to the system and then only able to view, say, secret data and\n\nDaniel Walsh: um, traditionally they've done this with Essie Linux, but the problem with SEO Linux is that if the user just does standard commands, like LS of an environment, he's likely just to get at or ABC generation on places that he shouldn't be looking at and so becomes very complex because I like to say is a essay Linux is complex because we give you in a view of everything in the universe and then\n\nDaniel Walsh:  We basically say, You know, why you're looking, you know, basically SEO is gonna say why you're looking here, why you're looking it while you're looking here, and with containers, we give you a view of almost nothing of the operating system. And then we just start opening up windows to the up the operating system through volumes. And so becomes a lot easier for people to say, You know, okay, you can get on my system. But the only thing you can see is this directory on my system. And that becomes, That's a lot more human understandable than you get. On my system, you can see everything. And then I start to block you from looking at parts.\n\n00:10:00\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: I remember we had a FTP server and when we went to Not to the same option of ftps but to Sftp, then we then we ended up running shells where you previously were just sewing files. So so that that was the use case back in the day with a custom shell,\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh: Right.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: that only allowed you to visit certain directories and run certain commands. That sftp. So, that could be.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Yeah, right. I mean, 10 to 15 years ago, I talked about Doing some stuff with Etsy, Linux around guests. And next guest and I just used to talk about how you could You know, imagine like you asked Machine at a at a library where you come in and Basically, will allow you to Web browsing and\n\nDaniel Walsh:  You know, going. Use the printers and things like that, we'll be really nice of that. Everything you did while you were in that web, browser was destroyed. When you logged out and that, that could be a use case for someone like this as well. Where you would, you just set up a container that Allows you to do whatever you want but as soon as you log out of the system, you know, the container gets destroyed. So imagine a container that's still in a dash dash RM. So, all the content was was cleaned up after you got out. So, If you did something stupid like do online banking and have secrets stored by the Web browser and at least it would be destroyed.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  And I mean, there are decent amount of use cases for something like this. I believe,\n\nTom Sweeney: some more people can look at,\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Not yet. Who are not we're not trying to make this as fully separate projects from Podmin. I think it's a I think it's an enhancement department, just another command that probably can use, so my goal would be to To write documentation in pod, Man, how to do it. And Just have the command put on a system so it'll be a pod man. Shell Which is probably in shell, it will just be a symbolic link to Bod man and Maybe it'll be a sub package but I don't want to get into a whole separate project for this. because again, it's just gonna This is just something that Pod man can do.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  You just have to create the Quad button.\n\nTom Sweeney: Great. Any other questions or comments?\n\nDaniel Walsh: We sometimes call it Container Shell but I've been calling it podman Shelton more recently. So Hopefully in it when we get together and do demos, we can demo it in a few weeks.\n\nTom Sweeney:  That be good a couple weeks away. Um all right, even that I and the time I think I'm going to hand it off to it on Anders for the storage talk.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah. So we had a previous meeting where I'm also asking a question, but we didn't have time for any answer, so I guess I will just ask it again. It was really about two separate. Features one is called lazy pulling where you divide a big layer into I mean, without breaking compatibility. You can divide container layer into Sub. Files, so that you can start the container without pulling all of it until it's needed. And related to that was the other question of peer-to-peer distribution of images without having to always pull it from the central registration.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund:  And I guess it's would be a question for containers image, or I mean, Portman would just use the storage.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund:  Object. So there's some support about anything in container D. That's why I was asking if there's any like OCI work or if it's anything that could come to. Podman on those.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Yes. Um Giuseppe's, not here, not. I believe that this\n\nDaniel Walsh:  We see if I can ping Giuseppe on this. Use around early, but I'm\n\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, thank you.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  forgot.\n\nTom Sweeney: Son Holiday today.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  The, I believe we have some, we can handle this. From what we don't have right now is you need a fuse file system to make this thing work.\n\n00:15:00\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Because the basic idea is you go. To run an image and container storage would say the image exists. And then you go, now you read Use a bin foobar and as soon as you execute, you've been full bar. The. underlying fuse file system would reach out to the registry and say Okay I need use of infobar and then User been full power. Would pull down say it needs G loop C. You pull down to your love C. And Continue on through the entire stack. I know that the person who wrote that originally are someone worked with, it opened up, pull request to get features like that into container storage. But I don't think anybody ever finalized it by putting in, you know, somehow getting the\n\nDaniel Walsh: The underlying file system to do it. And my mind it would be best to enhance. Fuse. Overlay to Be able to handle it, but it's not something that anybody at Redhead is has worked on at this point. The reason we haven't really looked at it is because the latency problem, but I I think it is a reasonable issue. We've always referred to constant. So, try to avoid the latency where you'd have an application up and running. For a little bit and then also just go into a pause mode when it's downloading. gigabytes of state and\u2026\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund:  Right.\n\nDaniel Walsh: as opposed to downloading everything and then you don't have any latency.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund:  Okay. Yeah. So\n\nDaniel Walsh: So I I would say I'm all for it. I'm all for us getting this into the upstream project. but rather than having I I'm not sure what the fuse file system that implements it, but if we get that fuse file system merged somehow into fuse overlay,\u2026\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah. Not.\n\nDaniel Walsh: I get it to be you mode if he was overly and we don't have two foul, two fuse file systems for supporting Someone desperate that things.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: yeah, and not exactly sure how it's implemented in the snapshot directly as it's calling continuity, but it has this, you need a, You need a special tar format in order to handle these I mean division of the horrified.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  but,\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: So That was us.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  It's it's related. Is. I think it's\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund:  And I think we had, we had two different versions, right? We had one based on said standard and that compression and we had one based on the older work with the S tar. That, I'm not sure if it was Google or something. So, It seemed to be multiple implementations of the same idea. Being able to hack one tour streaming to It's seekable portions while keeping compression.\n\nDaniel Walsh: I'm going through Google's, all right. contain a storage to figure out who opened up the pull request, but looking for a star right now,\u2026\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund:  Yeah.\n\nDaniel Walsh: but It's all just.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund:  now, I think we took there was some talk about it, like previous container plumbing, but not this one. So maybe like you say there are other concerns that are more important, so it's not the most desired feature\n\nDaniel Walsh:  yeah, what yeah, I mean I don't I just don't think that\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Yeah, I can't find who wrote it now. And do you remember anything about this?\n\nNalin Dahyabhai: I would have to go digging through it as soon as you.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah. But yeah,\u2026\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: It was.\n\nDaniel Walsh: as I said,\u2026\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: It was a hero talking about it. So,\n\nDaniel Walsh: I'm you know, it's just hasn't come up as an interest for You know,\u2026\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund:  Okay.\n\nDaniel Walsh: that the developers at Red Hat at this point to, to support this and just mainly because of the fuse vial system problem and\u2026\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah. Yeah,\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh: Now we haven't focused on. Yeah.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: I run into some similar issues. What while trying to promote peer-to-peer pulling over images and that is You can easily. You can easily set it to allow the private network only, but most peer-to-peer systems are public by default, which means people are terrified. So when you, when you mention an appear to pair is like mentioning Dr. Hub, you tell that to the private really stupid people and\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Right.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: they go into defensive mode and then it's for lockdown and everything. but,\n\n00:20:00\n\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah. Similar. We've been talking about that for about eight eight or ten years now. So,\n\nDaniel Walsh: Nothing. Nothing is happened in that front. And sadly,\u2026\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund:  Yeah. So\n\nDaniel Walsh: we don't have the people who work in containers imager here, because they're on holiday\u2026\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: I, Yeah,\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh: because yeah. So,\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: I'm also supposed to be on holidays and relate.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund:  Yeah, that's right.\n\nDaniel Walsh: So we can put that. I mean, if you don't mind, we'll put that one on hold for what.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yes, you can come back to it.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Let's talk about it.\n\nTom Sweeney: Up. Yeah.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Let's talk about it next month. When\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: yeah, I think Ipfs is quite experimental anyways, so you could probably do with some more maturing That there were also some like halfway solutions\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Yeah.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: where you would not hack up the layers, but you would distribute images from your peers. So you you would talk to your peers and then And then see if anyone close to you has the image before putting it from the registry. So, so,\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: there were some work, like\n\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, that would be cool. I think the the issue and they might have with that is how signing and and could you verify the image and make sure it's the Because yeah,\u2026\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund:  That yeah, it can assume so private.\n\nDaniel Walsh: the field comes I asked for, you know, the fedora image and someone so I got a fedora image for you. Yeah, take this one. How do you trust it? No.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund:  Yeah.\n\nTom Sweeney: Right, so we're compost bone, that one. So the next meeting then gets more folks here.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah, fun.\n\nTom Sweeney: And thanks for bringing up Anders and keep me honest, I put it on to the possible topics for the next one. I had thought the next one that we're going to do was with Maureen Duffy's and I thought She's gonna be here. So I will just do a real quick talk about it based on what I've seen Ashley here. Ashley, do you want to talk about this or give a quick little\n\nAshley Cui: so, Sorry.\n\nTom Sweeney:  Appointment.\n\nAshley Cui: um, I don't have anything prepared, but I guess. Take.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Just demonstrate the website.\n\nAshley Cui:  Okay. Let's see.\n\nTom Sweeney:  Nothing like putting you on the spot.\n\nAshley Cui:  Let me see if I can share the tab for Partner and IL.\n\nTom Sweeney: And while she's doing that, I'll just say that it's gone to be 1.0 officially, as of this morning, we're getting it ready for the summit, for Brent, for next week. So it'll be announced there more officially. She can have. A sneak preview this week.\n\nAshley Cui: Um, so we have a new website Podmanio. It's been it's nice and shiny and it looks very very good but I guess it is brand new. So we haven't gone through, we're trying to go through and take a look at anything that is broken and so we've been kind of taking a look at it, we have a bunch of Links and Other Things. I don't know what else to say about it. Other than it looks really nice but I think there's still a little bit of work that we're doing but if you have some time, feel free to click through it and see what works, what you guys like and what you don't like. And we'll see what we can do about it, I guess.\n\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, and I'll just go ahead and add a little bit more, just basically, it's on Github, container spot. is the old site was if you had happened to Clone that site Prior Appointment.io, it's now point. Automan.io underscore old. So if you try and make an update there, go to the old site and not to the new site so you'll need to reclone if you've cloned prior and please just standard issues, if you have just use a standard issue process, If you find anything go at Adam there and Maureen's been very responsive there for the ones that we found and do know that we've got a couple more. Online in there right now that you need to chase down and hoping to clear those up with the next few days, but happy to get any kind of feedback there and even if it's, you know, This doesn't work so well or Hey, this looks great. At least have.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Like, click on Get started, actually.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Like I wait. Where's the one that title spell how to download because it's going to show. Is that this one?\n\nAshley Cui: so we don't it's just on the front page, we have a little download drop down, I actually Was working on. Hold on. Let me see.\n\nAshley Cui:  Let's see.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Because one of the things we we have done is sort of. There's obviously there's podman desktop and then pod man. Main. And and this website is somewhat of a combination of the two.\n\n00:25:00\n\nAshley Cui:  Yep.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Because I think general users are just going to look, how do I get Pod, Man on my Mac or How do I get Bod, Man on my Windows box?\n\nDaniel Walsh:  For some like Pod man. I think the Linux, she's community is a little more savvy about how you probably gonna get a package on the addition. So, we wanted to make, you know, obvious places, they go to his apartment.io and Um, make it easy for you to find.\n\nAshley Cui:  Actually worked on this this morning which is now there's a CLI option so you can download desktop and you can also get the CLI. And so it's kind of a combination, you know, if it tries to point you into the desktop direction, if you want the desktop stuff and then it also gives you option of looking for CLI stuff. Yeah.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  And so if you were on a Mac, you would see one that says Downloaded for a Mac I would hope.\n\nAshley Cui:  Yeah, so automatically detects what OS you're on, which is pretty cool.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Do you want to promote the podman engine name instead of Podma CLI, which could also relate to podman remote?\n\nAshley Cui: um, sure. I think it might be confusing for people who don't know the difference between podman engine and podman desktop I think CLI. Kind of makes it obvious that this is a CLI tool, but\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: But but what so, so the primary option is downloading Padman desktop. And then quadman CLI.\n\nAshley Cui:  mm-hmm.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Would that be the podman remote for that desktop? Or would it be the one that includes the actual running up containers? Like the full partner?\n\nAshley Cui: I think. It's just podman itself for I guess for Linux.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: So, Yeah.\n\nAshley Cui: It is the engine but for Mac and Windows, it would just be a CLI so I guess technically it is. I think we can like change this saying like installed engine using a package manager or something like that, but If that makes it more clear.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Tabs. I was just wondering if yeah, I was just wondering if the Like now Portman desktop has gotten all the\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund:  Advertisements, if you want to call it that or my life. So something similar happened to Docker. So I mean, it's only natural. They, they have some kind of product entry for. So, we have a product entry for the Docker desktop, and you have a product entry for the docker engine, which Dumps. You straight into the Linux distributions and how to install on your server type of thing.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund:  something similar could be done for pod money if you want to separate the ones while having like the podmon desk focus here and then you could have like a separate Section for how you install podman on, on your Linux machine and how you run podman, not remotely. But have ironic locally. I mean like the old site if you want to call it back, how are you?\n\nAshley Cui: Yeah. I think we could put more documentation on this stuff.\n\nAshley Cui:  And clarify it. Yeah.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, it's funny. I'm not crazy about the name engine because I don't think I don't think that's a No,\u2026\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: No, no.\n\nDaniel Walsh: no. You normal user term so It's Eli.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: It's you know, now the whole desktop is just\n\nDaniel Walsh: Is I I would prefer to say probably five minutes for Linux, but we're we're starting to blank shed at this point.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund:  Yeah. Okay.\n\nDaniel Walsh: So, yeah, he's least here Icon makes it a little bit clearer\u2026\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: So, I No,\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh: but yeah.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: no, those are definitely someone else's words and terms. So they are just,\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Yeah.\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: they are just there to make the transition easier for people if you would start out. From scratch, we will not call it.\n\nDaniel Walsh: yeah, I use I use engine all the time but I'm not sure that you know,\u2026\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: I think that even the programs this Indian I\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh: Joe engine is and yeah,\n\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: if you're on Portman version, it will tell you. It's and I think so.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Okay.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  That's good.\n\nTom Sweeney: Right. Yeah it does look good. Actually thank you for doing well with that. Given how much time you have to prepare?\n\nDaniel Walsh:  And if anybody from community wants to contribute, we'd love to have contributions. You don't have to be. Engineer to contribute to that website.\n\nTom Sweeney:  Yes.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  So this this is actually Just an idea. We haven't done much work on it yet, but\n\nDaniel Walsh:  People have been asking us for examples of how to use. Different tools and darker has this thing called awesome compose. And a lot of people go to awesome compose to get darker composed examples so they can sort of take and then hack on. So, a few people have been paying us about. Could we have some kind of Site like that. And I think the obvious thing for\n\n00:30:00\n\nDaniel Walsh:  For us to work on would be to first grade aside and then allow people to start to contribute, say either Kubernetes Yaml files or quadlets that people might want to experiment with. So the idea was to set up, get up containers slash App Store. And then steps to sub directories underneath it, where people could start opening up. Poor request to get their favorite. you know, variant on\n\nDaniel Walsh:  You know, how they want to run their WordPress inside of a quadlet, or how they would run, you know? Base Inside of Kubernetes. Now what we want to have, if we start to build out this, we probably need to have some kind of cicd system where we would continuously test. All the quadlets and Yaml files that are available against, you know, a versions of Pod man, to make sure that they continue working and then If stuff becomes stale and old, then we have to get rid of it. I think the fair with something like this is, is one stuff gets old and crusty and I also worry about, if we had image that people are putting versions of images into their examples,\n\nDaniel Walsh:  People start to pull down images that the two or three years out of date. And how do we do? So It's I think we've talked about this internally. Chris is pointed out that I think renovate can actually help us out a little bit with that secondary problem and that it could go through a win actually update. Of images or open, a pull request to update version of images. So,\n\nDaniel Walsh:  I just opening up to have. Anybody have any ideas or thoughts on this?\n\nBrent Baude: I do. I spoke to someone that Mark Russell. Had. been speaking with, I think they actually know each other from canonical. And the gentleman's name is George.\n\nBrent Baude:  I think it's George Castro. And George has been proposing to Mark that this exact concept. Minus quadlet. Needed to get done and was looking for a home. to put all of us, he evidently has oodles of the stuff already done. And I spoke with them about an hour and 15 minutes basically. He just, He wants to do what we've we're meeting and wants a spot. Put it. That somewhat associated with containers.\n\nBrent Baude:  He was going to reach out the Tom to actually get on the schedule for today, but He must not have been able to, in the short order.\n\nBrent Baude: But I think the next thing it is just having come talk. About what his ideas and\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh: See.\n\nBrent Baude: What? He's got already.\n\nBrent Baude:  And he he's looking for us just like simple.\n\nBrent Baude:  It there's some stuff he hasn't figured out like you know, container wise and there's some stuff that, you know, could go this way, could go that way. He's just looking for Tyree. And advice.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Then we can get chat GPT to just start generating these things for us.\n\nBrent Baude: well, I think the problem that this team has Is we are?\n\nBrent Baude: Container cools. Development. And that's fundamentally different than container service or container. Creation.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Right.\n\nBrent Baude: And We probably all have our little pet projects. I'm guessing none of us are my sequel. Experts or, you know, we can get nginx running but just enough to serve a file. so,\n\nDaniel Walsh:  I can get in a patchy Web server up and curl to it, and that's about it.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  And basically none of us are real good systems. Yeah, at least that's not I call function.\n\n00:35:00\n\nBrent Baude:  Right. So again, at my vote, I'd like to the deeper dive with George and You know, spin them off and get gone.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Yeah.\n\nDaniel Walsh: I think.\n\nBrent Baude: And it sounds like yes,\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: time bit to this.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah. It'd be nice\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh: if someone went through all of awesome, awesome compose and Wrote equivalent applications and Kubernetes YAML files. And That could run with part men. I'm trying to make sure that they don't become a General Kubernetes Yaml drop site because it might be lots. And lots of stuff that podman can't handle. That's why I like the idea of Verifying that the applications would actually ride with, but man.\n\nBrent Baude: indeed and I I know fair amount of those Apps, if you will, that are in awesome and some of them don't do anything. That just like Hello World type stuff.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Right.\n\nBrent Baude: so I think ideally what you're looking for is Put your gunk in this volume and then make sure it gets mounted.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Right.\n\nChristopher Evich: I'm guessing. That probably. Writing tests for these things. It's going to be equal to if not harder than developing them in the first place. Especially the,\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Yeah.\n\nChristopher Evich: what the, what that stuff. I mean if it's simple things like curling from URL, using my SQL client to connect to A I see how container with that. Kind of stuff can probably do, but I think more complex. Can get challenging.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah. but I I just start a service and then a five minute inspected to make sure that you know, the the stuff that you thought was gonna be creative, got created, then\n\nChristopher Evich: Yeah.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  again, when I'm hoping, is that, if we start getting these things and images start disappearing that week and easily clean out, Applications as sort of disappear from the base of the planet, right? People's priorities change and they're not going to necessarily maintain their own. Applications that get donated to the site.\n\nBrent Baude: There's there's also this question of You know, do you tag it? Like let's say you're gonna do You know, my sequel or something? Do you\n\nBrent Baude:  You know. But there's a fair amount of variety that could occur whether you depend on. Building the image. My sequel image, Do you start at like the winter level and then all the way up? Or do you grab them and use my sequel? And then how does the the versioning work because if you if you go latest, then your subject to failures in which something inside the image changes, which, which puts ed into orbit,\n\nBrent Baude:  Or you say tag it to a particular version and and now you know, you have to go update that at some point.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, I mean that's what also something we have to worry about with the Cicd system. Again we're all channeling it here because in those there's nothing more unstable than container registries as far as Cicd systems. So, You know, if if 75% of the time that Test suite. Blows up because it couldn't pull down and some random image and You know, we're never gonna get it successful Testro.\n\nBrent Baude: the other little, Treat here would be that also if I was a consumer of that. Stuff. I don't think I'd want something pointing to latest either.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Right.\n\nBrent Baude: but I would like to be notified when You know, a new image comes up. In case it was security.\n\nChristopher Evich: Renovate can run away. Runaway can handle that pretty elegantly. There's You can set up regular expressions. That can extract version numbers. And it'll And then basically give it a source of where those versions come from and it'll open up yours when it finds a new one. There's also a way you can do kind of a more generic thing. That's probably more user friendly. where you set up a regular expression that searches for a comment, a special comment that says You know, get the versions from the source, use this type of versioning and the other options like that. That's probably easier. Then it's just adding this stuff is just you know, somebody putting a comment into their Code. And Renovator pick it up automatically.\n\n00:40:00\n\nDaniel Walsh: So, it seems like I think I've already created the the website. Containers. App Store. Just make sure it's\n\nDaniel Walsh:  It's nice and blank right now. Has a license in a one-line. Text.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  I do that a week ago and then forgot about it.\n\nTom Sweeney: Can you add a link to the chat?\n\nDaniel Walsh:  I will.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  My goal was to create two subdirectories underneath. It one called Kubernetes and one called What?\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Github will not let you create empty directories and then check them in. You have to put content in the directories and I didn't have any content and then, Some of the sparkly light went off. And I went chasing after. Whatever. That was so.\n\nTom Sweeney: Know, did you just drop a green beans? Each Just a real quick, read me.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Could I drop could I drop one?\n\nChristopher Evich: It put a dot and put a dot MP file in.\n\nTom Sweeney:  Yeah. And in the directors you want to create just put a little readme at the top.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Law. Okay, that would have been nice. But now that I have this site up You can open up a pull request to do that.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Want to become Sawyer. I want you to paint my wall. White wash my fence.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  I guess we can open up the general discussion at this point.\n\nTom Sweeney: There's any questions topics that anybody has?\n\nLance Lovette: I've got one.\n\nLance Lovette: so, I've been curious that the past through log driver, It's not really clear to me when I should or would want to use that as opposed to Journal D. or if Pod Man selects a default based on where it's running,\n\nLance Lovette:  At the moment, I specified Journal. D explicitly and I'm wondering if As I went down this rabbit hole where Kanman takes standard by default, well, it takes standard air and marks it red in the logs and python logs, right? Everything to standard air. So everything that Python writes shows up. In red said, I went down this rabbit hole, figure that out, and then I change this law and I figured out the issue but I was like maybe I should be using pass through instead of journal D. So anybody have any Direction or guidelines on how to decide one or the other.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  I take. I take the goal of pass through is that if you're running it underneath this as a systemd service, and pass through will allow you when you do a pod man system d status, you'll be able to see it right in the Be a system D, right? And then if you run journal, you'd have to use Pod, Man command or a journal to, you wouldn't see it as part of the outputs, the unit file. I believe it's what the difference is.\n\nLance Lovette: Well, you, I believe you do. I mean well, Because I'm doing Journal D, now. And that everything, you know, journal controlled at Jeff shows everything, it all gets tagged with the with the proper.\n\nDaniel Walsh: But are you doing it on the unit file or\u2026\n\nLance Lovette:  Variables.\n\nDaniel Walsh: you're doing it of the container level?\n\nLance Lovette: Well, I both I run it in the like when I run it standalone, it's I use log driver. And then when you do make system D, it captures that.\n\nDaniel Walsh: But doesn't do it.\n\nLance Lovette: So so my container. Yeah.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Does it switch to pass through at that point?\n\nLance Lovette: No, I mean not. I'm Yeah,\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh:  It's the journal? Yeah. Yeah.\n\nLance Lovette: so across the board I especially specify Log Driver Journal, D, You know, does pod men do something under the covers like Oh hey, I'm a system D service. So let's use pass through. I can't say\n\nDaniel Walsh:  No. No, it does it, I don't believe it does. Matt, The original version of Quadlet was attempting to do that. I believe and I think that's all been revoked, but\n\nLance Lovette: Because I don't know what Journal D. Or what system D. Does with outputs, like I have a dove into it enough to live like are they somewhat equivalent? Like if you're if you're using all generally driver, it's still sticking in the journal and if you do it through system D, it just attaches. Standard out to the journal, like I haven't really dug into that. So it may be equivalent. when it's running under system D, then it may be a, you\u2026\n\n00:45:00\n\nDaniel Walsh: Then. But that wouldn't make that would not make sense of that passed through.\n\nLance Lovette: one of the other\n\nDaniel Walsh: That I thought pass through just meant right to stand it out standard error and all inside a unifile. But I might be mistaken. Matt, do you know?\n\nMatt Heon: That is definitely the intention pass through is basically it will have CON monologue directly to standard out standard error and since Systemd is monitoring commodity will print it directly to the journal? The intention Giuseppe is the one who added it. So I don't want to speak for necessarily because I'm not a hundred percent of why it's there, but I believe the attention was better integration into what they call it better integration with podme and inside a System D unit in certain circumstances but I'm not completely aware of what those circumstances are. There's also happened in a much earlier time at the life of the journal log driver At that point we were not well integrated with basically the journal log driver was not logging to the same.\n\nMatt Heon:  You get logs, but they wouldn't show up as the associated with the unit in question, I think that has been fixed since. So it might be that some of the reasons we're using it to have gone away, I will say it, certainly simpler than the Journalty log driver and probably a lot more performance.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, I think that one of the problems would pass through is that if you do a pod, man logs then you don't see it anymore, right?\n\nLance Lovette: All right, well, maybe I'll play around with it and\n\nDaniel Walsh: But the most most likely Lance what I would say is, if you like it, what? Journal D. I would stick with General Day and not just pass through because when that Would my only thing is is if I do a status of the unit file or journal control dash u of the unit file. Do I see the the data that's coming out of the container? You know,\u2026\n\nLance Lovette: Right, right? Because now I'm trying to think.\n\nDaniel Walsh: then I would if that works with journal journal, then that's, that, probably all you really care about. So, I would just\u2026\n\nLance Lovette: Right. Yeah,\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh: because then part\n\nLance Lovette: because I guess I guess there's some interaction with Kanmon there. Yeah, I'm not sure\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Yeah.\n\nLance Lovette: who exactly is tagging. Entries with all the variables that toddman attaches.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  Could you basically when you run Pod, man as a When you run pod man inside of System, D unit file and podman goes away. What system D is watching is konmon\n\nDaniel Walsh:  if cotton on outputs any standard out, a standard error, that's sort of what a traditional service would do. Instead of a system to unit, follow if Con Mohan is writing directly to the journal, Then, I'm not sure if you see that, you see the same behavior, as if it was right into, stand it out and standard error. That, that would be my question.\n\nLance Lovette: Right. Yeah, it's interesting. Yeah, I mean yeah, like I said, me at the moment I get I kind of got once I fixed the Python syslog thing. It's working the way I like it to. So All right,\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah. We're all about flexibility here, but\n\nLance Lovette: good. yeah, all those play with it and it probably is like I said journal D's been around a while so probably some of it's been Alleviated in the last couple of years. Thanks.\n\nDaniel Walsh:  yeah.\n\nTom Sweeney: Okay, any other questions or discussions? And close to the end of the meeting.\n\nTom Sweeney:  I'm not hearing anything, so I'm just going to give a quick reminder for our next meetings. Our next community meeting is on Tuesday, June 6th. So that's just around the corner a couple weeks from now right after holiday in the US and then our cabal meeting will be on June 15th. And both of those meetings will be at 11, a clock. June 15th is Thursday in the Community Institute Tuesday. And so, for puzzle topic, we already have two lined up. One is the IPSS integration that Anders was talking about earlier. And then also, some more talks about the App Store. If anybody has any other topics, please let me know. These are through the hacking, these scripts, we're hacking deep site or by saying me an email, so any other questions or comments before I turn off the recording here?\n\nTom Sweeney:  Right, well then, thank you for coming today and turn off the recording.\n\nTom Sweeney:  and it is stopped anything you want to say before without being recorded,\n\n00:50:00\n\nTom Sweeney: Silent group about. Let's go to lunch dinner. Enjoy the rest of my holiday. If you're in Europe. Right. All thanks.\n")))}ai.isMDXComponent=!0;const oi={},ii="Podman Community Meeting Notes",si=[{value:"June 6, 2023 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-5)",id:"june-6-2023-1100-am-eastern-utc-5",level:2},{value:"Attendees ( 40 total)",id:"attendees--40-total",level:3},{value:"Topics",id:"topics",level:3},{value:"Meeting Start: 11:04 a.m. EDT",id:"meeting-start-1104-am-edt",level:2},{value:"Video Recording",id:"video-recording",level:3},{value:"ChRIS project running in Podman via Podman desktop",id:"chris-project-running-in-podman-via-podman-desktop",level:2},{value:"Jennings Zhang and Rudolph Pienaar",id:"jennings-zhang-and-rudolph-pienaar",level:3},{value:"(1:20 in the video)",id:"120-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Podman Desktop v1.0 Update",id:"podman-desktop-v10-update",level:2},{value:"Stevan LeMeur",id:"stevan-lemeur",level:3},{value:"(30:25 in the video)",id:"3025-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Podmansh Demo",id:"podmansh-demo",level:2},{value:"Lokesh Mandvekar",id:"lokesh-mandvekar",level:3},{value:"(41:29 in the video)",id:"4129-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Podman v4.6 Demo",id:"podman-v46-demo",level:2},{value:"Matt Heon",id:"matt-heon",level:3},{value:"(44:47 in the video)",id:"4447-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Open Forum/Questions?",id:"open-forumquestions",level:2},{value:"(50:06 in the video)",id:"5006-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Topics for Next Meeting",id:"topics-for-next-meeting",level:2},{value:"Next Meeting: Tuesday, August 1, 2023, 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-4)",id:"next-meeting-tuesday-august-1-2023-1100-am-eastern-utc-4",level:2},{value:"Next Cabal Meeting: Thursday, June 15, 2023, 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-4)",id:"next-cabal-meeting-thursday-june-15-2023-1100-am-eastern-utc-4",level:2},{value:"Meeting End: 11:59 a.m. Eastern (UTC-4)",id:"meeting-end-1159-am-eastern-utc-4",level:3},{value:"Google Meet Chat copy/paste:",id:"google-meet-chat-copypaste",level:2},{value:"Raw Google Meet Transcription",id:"raw-google-meet-transcription",level:2}],ri={toc:si},li="wrapper";function hi(e){let{components:t,...n}=e;return(0,Ne.kt)(li,(0,ce.Z)({},ri,n,{components:t,mdxType:"MDXLayout"}),(0,Ne.kt)("h1",{id:"podman-community-meeting-notes"},"Podman Community Meeting Notes"),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"june-6-2023-1100-am-eastern-utc-5"},"June 6, 2023 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-5)"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"attendees--40-total"},"Attendees ( 40 total)"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Aditya Rajan, Ashley Cui, Banu Ahtam, Brent Baude, Chetan Giradkar, Christopher Evich, Ed Haynes, Ed Santiago Munoz, Gerry Seidman, gideon pinto, Hyuk Jin Yun, Jake Correnti, Jean-Francois Maury, Jennings, Jennings's Presentation, Lance Lovette, Leon Nunes, listener, Lokesh Mandvekar, Lokesh Mandvekar's Presentation, M\xe1ir\xedn Duffy, Mark Russell, Martin Jackson, Matt Heon, Miloslav Trmac, Mohan Boddu, Nalin Dahyabhai, Navaneeth krishna, Nezih Nieto Gutierrez, Paul Holzinger, Preethi Thomas, Rudolph Pienaar, sandip samal, Shion Tanaka (\u7530\u4e2d \u53f8\u6069), Stevan Le Meur, Stevan Le Meur's Presentation, Sungmin You, tasmiah chowdhury, Tim deBoer, Tim Rudenko, Tom Sweeney, Tom Sweeney's Presentation, Urvashi Mohnani"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"topics"},"Topics"),(0,Ne.kt)("ol",null,(0,Ne.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"ChRIS project running in Podman via Podman desktop - Jennings Zhang and Rudolph Pienaar"),(0,Ne.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Podman Desktop v1.0 Update - Stevan LeMeur"),(0,Ne.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Podmansh Demo - Lokesh Mandvekar"),(0,Ne.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Podman v4.5 Demo/Talk - Matt Heon")),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"meeting-start-1104-am-edt"},"Meeting Start: 11:04 a.m. EDT"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"video-recording"},"Video ",(0,Ne.kt)("a",{parentName:"h3",href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65pE8RhCK5w&t=116s"},"Recording")),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"chris-project-running-in-podman-via-podman-desktop"},"ChRIS project running in Podman via Podman desktop"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"jennings-zhang-and-rudolph-pienaar"},"Jennings Zhang and Rudolph Pienaar"),(0,Ne.kt)("h4",{id:"120-in-the-video"},"(1:20 in the video)"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Demo (1:35 in the video)\nShowed a picture of a fetus in a Woman's uterus.

So I will welcome everybody. Today to the Podman Community Meeting Today. Thursday June 6th 2023.\nStevan Le Meur: Krishna.\nTom Sweeney: We have a large list of things to go through today. First thing that we're going to be looking at, is the Chris Project learning and podman via podman desktop from Jennings, Zinc, and Rudolph. Can you Allen? I hope I didn't butcher either of your names there for that one. Matt in, we'll be talking about the problem and 4.5, And then Dan Walsh if he's here, I'm not sure, there's kind of some question about whether or not to be able to make it today, we'll be doing a quadlet demo.\nTom Sweeney:  And then the plug-in desktop, 1.0 update will be given my stuff on them here and then a portman sh demo will be given by Lokesh at the end. So we've got a pre-fold day, we will have time for questions if you have some and with all that I think I'm going to just all mine folks that we have a hack MD script, which I'll put a link to in the chat. If you I will be taking notes there. If you see that, I done something badly in the notes, please feel free to Ed and presenters. If you have links or such that you want to make sure that we have, the notes that will be posted later on the website. Please go ahead and add those to the hack. Empty. Yes we go on. So I'm going to stop presenting now and head it over to Jennings. It's gonna be talking about the curse projects.\nJennings: All right. Hi everyone.\nJennings:  Alright, so my name is Jennings and I'm supervised by my Pi Rudolph Pienaar together. We're working on the Chris project at the Boston Children's Hospital. And our lab does a lot of research on fetal imaging and also newborn imaging where we use MRI to study very young patients. And so what you see on screen here is an example of what a fetus MRI looks like, while it's still in the pregnant mother seers. To do this kind of research. We need a lot of niche open source software because it's a very specialized division of medicine. And so,\nJennings:  What we're working on the Chris project is helping to orchestrate the digital cyber infrastructure to actually be able to run these open source pipelines just to give a brief example of what one of these pipelines may be. We have a fetal MRI processing pipeline, which is going to take all of these multiple in Europe, images of varying quality. It's going to try to use some image processing. Algorithms such as masking and quality assessment to, finally be able to reconstruct these multiple in utero images into one high quality. Cropped volume. And what we can do, with these processed data, is we can try to quantify metrics of the brain. While it's developing in utero and this is what a fetal brain looks like. While it's still developing at 25 weeks of gestational age through 32, justational weeks of age,\nJennings:  Using these open source tools. We are able to measure the growth of specific parts of the brain as well. And look at the trends as the pregnancy continues. And so the infrastructure that we have at the Boston Children's Hospital is, of course, we have these scanners. We also have open. Sorry. Not we have Some high performance computing centers. And we also have the office space where our researchers sit and what the crisp project does is it connects all of these things together. Uh, researchers can be at their desks looking at the Chris user interface, and they're able to dispatch computational jobs to both our internal high performance computing center. And we're also able to ship jobs out to our public clouds as well with the hybrid cloud architecture.\nJennings:  And so that's a quick demo of or sorry. A quick introduction on what the Chris project is, something that I've been working on recently, is being able to run Chris on podman and especially using podman Desktop So, I'll jump it up.\nJennings:  We have a github repository called Minicrisk Eights. And inside of here, we have several Kubernetes manifests aka Yamls and I also have a wrapper script called Minicris.sh. And what this wrapper script is going to do is it's going to bring together these animal files into something that can be consumed by podman desktop. Let's open up carbon and desktop.\nJennings:  Alright, here it is. I don't have many containers running, I'm just going to delete the sky.\n00:05:00\nJennings:  all right, when you want to run a Kubernetes, Manifest using Podman Desktop It Assets, a single Kubernetes file. I have my Kubernetes manifests organized as multiple Yaml files here. So this wrapper script called Mini Christ.sh is going to do two things. It's just going to simply concatenate all of my Yamls together, and it's also going to perform a said command to just replace some of the values. One key value that it needs to replace. We can take a quick look at it.\nJennings:  Yeah, so the function that I'm going to run is going to call be called minicrescat All it's doing is it's going to be concatenating. All of my yaml files and then it's going to be performing a set operation on to these variables. And that's just going to replace the hard-coded podman socket address with what's actually going to be running on my system, obtained from the podman Info command. Let's try that.\nJennings:  And it's just going to spit the yellow out to my standard out and I'll type it into a file. And now this file called Chris All-in-one by EML can be loaded into Podman Desktop.\nJennings:  As it says here with podman desktop. This Play Queue. Command can take a few minutes to complete. And the reason why is because podman behind the scenes is going to be starting the defined services and deployment sequentially. It's also going to try running in its containers which does things like database initialization and that's going to take a little while Another functionality of my monolithic script over here. Is that it can monitor podmin for init containers. So\nJennings:  that finished faster than I expected it to. I was going to say that we can look at what the unit containers are doing, but it seems like everything's up already, so let's just keep going. Yeah. So we can see we have a bunch of pods here we have. What's known as the Cube Pod? And that's our Chris backend. We have PF Khan, which is another Chris service that handles the compute that might be dispatched by Chris. We have the Chris UI which we'll take a look at later. That's our user interface. before we can take a look at Chris, I have a script called Prismatic Prismatic, which I can also run using podman, is going to initialize the Crist system with some information and that's going to create some users for testing purposes, and it's also going to\nJennings:  Add some programs or what we call, Christopher's plugins to the crisp system. And you can see that this mini Crits.sh chrismatic subcommand is just a podman run alias and it's going to run a new container as part of the cubed pod.\nJennings:  It's just going to run the charismatic command within the charismatic container. What that does is it reads a file called Prismatic.yaml to put a bunch of data into our Chris backend. And so what it's done here is it's created a super user called Chris and that's going to be a user that will log in as in a quick moment and it has registered a few simple programs for us to try running. To access the user interface. We can see that it's running over here on podman desktop. These logs say that it's running on port 3000 though. The port 3000 is mapped onto the host Port 8020, I believe yeah.\nJennings:  So, let's take a look.\nJennings:  This is the Chris user interface and from here, what we're able to do is you can click Login.\nJennings:  And yeah. Great new analysis.\nJennings:  In Chris, we have computational experiments organized as separate analyzes. And what I'm doing here is I'm going to create a new analysis with some uploaded data.\n00:10:00\nJennings: And now it's happening, is once I've uploaded the data into the Chris system, we can see it running in this Kris UI and I can choose to run more plugins here. When I choose to run a plugin such as this one of Click Add node, it's going to dispatch a container to podman and podman is going to run it. So if I'm lucky if I type Admin PS then it'll show the container running. I have to be kind of fast.\nJennings: I guess I lied about being the fast part.\nJennings:  It always breaks during demos. I have no idea why this guy ran but this guy doesn't I'll just try it again.\nTom Sweeney: The demographic, strong.\nJennings:  I'll just\nJennings: What was that? Yeah, they are.\nTom Sweeney:  The demo gods are strong.\nJennings: I can do another quick explanation of what's happening here. And what's happening here is This user interface is pretty much. Helping me build a command line. string that is eventually going to be forwarded to the podman socket and so,\nJennings:  This program that I'm trying to run called Simple DS. App is just a demonstration program. We have other programs as you've seen for imaging analysis and medical research. I'm just going to pass a command line parameter here, called Sleep length. 10 because I wanted to sleep for 10 seconds. Oh no, this guy failed.\nJennings: I feel like this one's also gonna fail, but yeah. Sadly, the demo gods have kicked us this time.\nJennings:  Well, that's mostly what we have here. We have the entire care system running in Admin, Desktop any questions?\nBrent Baude: Yeah, I have a few.\nBrent Baude:  I'm curious. Is there anything that podman could do? That would make this easier for you.\nJennings: Yeah. So Several things podman has pretty much innovated in the space of rootless containers and that's great because Chris is concerned about security and we need to make sure that these plugins aren't going to do anything malicious and if they do something malicious they can't break out of that. Container jail. a second thing is one of the key innovations of the Chris project itself, is that Chris plugins, unlike some other. Systems for computational research. Aims to be simple for developers. And I should be able to look at a terminal you here.\nJennings:  I'm not sure if you guys are familiar with the App Trainer command app. Tanner is a another container runtime similar to Docker apartment. And friends. But this obtainer command could also just be a podman command and podman would be a great candidate for having people be able to run these analyzes on their own systems. Because oddman is rootless and or podman supports rootless mode.\nRudolph Pienaar: If I can just quickly jump in with a meta comma to observation here. So you guys all hear me is my mic coming through. So, one of the things we're trying to do here,\u2026\n00:15:00\nTom Sweeney: Yep, bottom plants.\nRudolph Pienaar: right? Is, you know, you're so in the Chris UI beginning of like this, this connected graph of designers, So that's kind of at the heart of what we're trying to make fun, you know, distribute, right? So you can, you can construct and arbitrary complex tree of computing. where each one of those nodes is, is obviously a container and because\nRudolph Pienaar: That's a Jennings show in the beginning. You can have multiple different computing stages as you're doing, one of the things we're trying to do is to be able to publish and bundle together, the value of that computing tree. Simply and easily, right? So you can, you can describe your entire compute as a simple yaml file. Which literally is just describes the tree of computing, your almost a directed basically graph.\nRudolph Pienaar:  Mostly in research. What folks, end up, folks, end up doing right. Is they construct their workflows using bash? Scripts if they get to that level, And you know, as most of us know bash scripts are horrible to try and do anything with. And most of the coding there is is literally just coming, right? You know, it's all to do with data copying from one direction to another and stuff that all goes away in a system like this, you know, leveraging Crisps which sits above, you know, something like podman or Kubernetes, whatever the case may be, all of that goes away. Which we think is can be pretty useful for reproducible, computing and science and stuff like that. And another thing which which is maybe interesting useful to point out of here is and so I was a Red Hat summit last week.\nRudolph Pienaar:  There's a whole bunch of stuff, you know, about how in industry we can. You know. Deploy models of computing. Like AI models. How do we deploy them? The first, I can tell the industry model to do that. Is you take a data scientist working in Jupiter notebook. And that's all they ever do. And then an application engineer or development comes in and takes her Python Jupiter notebook and shoves it into a flask python. Framework or fast API and that fast API thing, you then go and throw on the Web and manage with Kubernetes or partner, whatever the case. and that's if you want, most people are doing and that's, there's nothing wrong with that, of course, but it just struck me that What ends up happening there is that you kind of entrenching the separation between you the primary developer like potato scientists.\nRudolph Pienaar:  Where it's going to be deployed. There's a huge gulf between them. Right. The data scientists. It doesn't know anything about flasks or fast API, they want to touch that. They don't interested in doing that. But in a system that we put together over here, the The actual thing that is deployed on the Web that is managed by Partman is managed by this whole system, is pretty much the exact code that you as a data scientists. Develop. so it's so it that that Delta between your prototype. Code, and the deploy code.\nRudolph Pienaar:  Is much much shallow smaller and shallower than what it, and what is the normal way? It means. So that's another innovation where I super excited about to do you, right? You can develop your stuff, you can be a data scientists. You don't even have in this case here, you don't have to know what man. We doing it all for you without scripts, but you are developing your code and you're able to deploy it locally on your own machine. And pretty much see what it would be like, in production. Skin. Anyway, that's just a quick quick. High-end plug here.\nStevan Le Meur: Well thanks a Rudolph. I think that's exactly what we are trying to to accomplisher. It's helping the developers to be able to produce locally. Things that they would run on production. So having something as close as possible from production is super critical. Who have fast turnarounds, when you are building your application. But also, when you are consuming it, as you use, just the mode in fact so wonderful. The demo is fantastic. I think, and it's really nice to see the technology being used for such cases, as well. That's, that's very nice.\nJennings: So I was able to get what I wanted to show running, which is I just rolled back to an earlier commit. That was working. So what I tried to do was I ran a second, plugin instance here. and you can see what I did was, I was trying to run this program called Simple DS up with a parameter called Sleep Length, 20. And here we can see the output in podman desktop as well. So what the cris system did was once it received the request to run a container. It handles, all of the handles fudging with the podman interface for you, And it created a container with heels and both DS up. And here's the output, I'm not sure if we'll be able to inspect it anymore. Yeah, I can't inspect that any more because Chris decided to delete the container, once it was done running, if it was still running, then you would be able to see the flags here as well.\n00:20:00\nJennings:  I also wanted to just quickly show off what Rudolph was talking about. So what I was showing here was just the stages of a biomedical compute pipeline. It often involves multiple steps and multiple programs that are going to be glued together by a bash script. If you've ever done any kind of scientific computing, you would understand what I'm talking about East Bash scripts or even CSH scripts are going to be maybe 4,000 lines long of gibberish. Whereas with Chris how we organize and orchestrate, these workflows is using a yaml schema\nJennings:  over to pull up. My browse organ. this is a pipeline that I've been working on, which Extracts surfaces aka just polygonal mesh, representations of the fetal brain cortex. From a reconstructed brain image and so it does some file conversions and it processes the left and right hemisphere separately. And this is specified using a declarative yaml syntax instead of bash.\nJennings: I also wanted to add to what Stevan was talking about. We have Chris deployed and targeting Openshift container platform. Unfortunately this week we were just on Lucky our\nJennings:  local cloud that we use. It's called the Massachusetts, Open Cloud and the New England Research Cloud. They are doing their yearly power down maintenance. So I can't show that off though. Typically Chris is deployed on Openshift and also uses Openshift for its public compute and one of the things about podman is it makes it easy where we can have this one set of Kubernetes, DML manifests that work on both Openshift and also just locally on my desktop\nJennings: I don't know if I'm supposed to be calling on people, but hello Matt.\nTom Sweeney: Oh sure. Go ahead.\nM\xe1ir\xedn Duffy: Hi. So my question for you because I know you guys were previously using Docker compose and I just wanted to know how was the transition been kind of coming from Docker compose into this setup?\nJennings: Yeah. Um, perhaps we should I noticed next in the schedule, someone's talking about quadlet which is something that we need to look into. I'll talk about why right now actually using Docker compose is a lot easier. For not necessarily the right reasons. It's because the her compose has a Insecure by default kind of mode of operand, which is great for developers. but, One of the things that I'm curious about is just trying to enforce the principle of least privileges here, and moving into podman was more difficult because of the Damon list thing. We need a Damon to talk which is why I'm running the podman socket and also the rootlessness thing, There were a few bugs there. But in general, the experience was somewhat good.\nJennings:  There are some key differences between how podman cube play works and how the actual Kubernetes system works or how Docker compose works. The two biggest discrepancies, are going to be that.\nJennings:  Podman cube play. Operates sequentially. What that means is it's going to create one pod or sorry. One container at a time and that's a problem. When you have containers depending on each other, in the world of docker, compose, or Kubernetes. These containers are going to start Asynchronously meaning If the dependencies aren't resolved, they'll just restart in a few seconds. And podman. I need to do the dependency resolution myself and how that works is. I've prefixed these with numbers denoting the order in which they are dependent. So I need my config maps first. And then I need my database and Q. Services which my backend is dependent on and then I have to run my back end near the end because it's dependent on the database and rapid MQ.\n00:25:00\nJennings:  Yeah, Brent.\nBrent Baude: Let me check with Tom first on time check, how are you feeling Tom.\nTom Sweeney: And we've got all just a few more minutes. I can go five more minutes but that's gonna be pushing it.\nBrent Baude:  Okay, I'm curious then. So when you say that, When you say that before with, I think it was composed and it's done. Sort of asynchronously. Are you handling?\nJennings: in docker compose, it's possible to specify the dependency order of containers. And that's not a perfect solution, but it is.\nJennings:  Better than sequential.\nBrent Baude:  Okay.\nJennings:  I think it's also supported in podmin composed, but we've tried to move off of podman compose and into podman play cube.\nBrent Baude:  Okay.\nJennings: So what you can see is when I'm running the Chris container over here, this is a docker compose file. I can increase the font size of it. This Chris service is defined with the auctions depends on, and the pens on is a list of other services, which must be started before the Chris service. This is good because we can make sure that these other services at least exist prior to Chris. This isn't a complete solution, because even though the containers themselves exist, these service might not be ready to accept connections yet, but still docker, composes able to figure out the dependency order and then start these both.\nJennings:  Asynchronously. And in the order that would satisfy the dependency tree with podman currently, the dependency resolution must be handled manually. This is also somewhat deviant from the communities spec. I'm not sure if it's part of the Kubernetes spec, but I would assume. So that every resource specified in a yaml file, Or sorry, the order of resources specified in a yaml file, should not matter. So,\nJennings:  What I have here is, I have a yaml file of a bunch of Kubernetes resources, they're separated by the Triple Dash syntax and in theory, or ideally the order of these services shouldn't matter. But when you're running it using podman, whether it be through podman desktop or podman cube play, the order does matter. You need to specify the dependencies before the dependence.\nBrent Baude: Okay, thank you.\nTom Sweeney: Any further questions. This has been great presentation. Great discussion.\nBrent Baude:  I assume Tom has your contact information if I would want to follow up, you 'D be willing to answer some.\nJennings: Yeah. Oh, I mentioned Someone's later going to present on quadlet. I would be very interested in hearing more about quadlet because to my understanding Quad lit, is where podman uses system D as DC. Orchestrator of some sorts. And so hopefully, system D can sidestep this issue. With plodman cube in my understanding, is podman is starting these services sequentially. But if we were to define domestic D unifiles and system D does start services in parallel. I hopefully this dependency resolution problem goes away.\nTom Sweeney:  Know unfortunately the speaker had to back out literally just after the meeting started. So we're not going to be discussing quality today but we can certainly get you in touch with him if you'd like to.\nBrent Baude: Who was the speaker, Tom? oh, Okay, we can. Yeah, we can do, we can arrange something for you.\n00:30:00\nTom Sweeney: Then, okay. And then not as moves, you down to the bottom of this agenda today, just so we can get to the other things too. If we don't get to the four, five update, I think we can get by without that. So next. Okay, next up. Step on me and just stop update.\nStevan Le Meur: Yeah. So I I think the demo that was just done by Jennings was a, just a very clearly illustration of how pen mendes that could be leverage for helping streamlining, container walkthroughs and streams. Most and if you can developer experience so this is great introduction. I will say so on, I'm going to share my skin. So we just announced the version 1.0 of Batman Desktop and We are really two weeks ago.\nStevan Le Meur:  In this version, as you might already know, we provide a user friendly interface for managing containers and working with Kubernetes directly from the local developer machine. So that's a bunch of things that we are trying to, to do from a component desktop, like abstracting the setup and the configuration of the entire container tooling. So you can create your appointment machine directly from the UI and you have the ability to to create your machine.\nStevan Le Meur: With or without good privileges as well. And as it has been demoted as well, just capabilities to play Kubernetes yamls directly from from the UI. So you can see your buds you can see The logs, you can interact with. we said with each of the containers, And you can get the Kubernetes manifests for. Somewhere. Oh, you applications. So you can easily test that onto. Onto a unto donuts around. So I can take A container.\nStevan Le Meur:  And I can say, Hey I want to run this container inside of a bud so I can create a pod on my container. I need locally with a man. and then, once I have this this environment, which is a, which is running, Once I have my bud running locally with Batman, I can easily deploy that onto Kubernetes environment. So I can test it on two different Kubernetes around and right now. From Batman Desktop, you can create a kind cluster which is a Kubernetes. Christopher running in input, man. So you can create the cluster.\nStevan Le Meur:  You will, you will have that NDF there are after a few seconds, a few few minutes depending on the on the network. And when you are in the context of of your bird and your images, you will have the ability to easily insight with the cluster so you will have the ability to push an image that you build locally. With Batman and you will be able to push that image directly onto the gain cluster. To use it into a deployment or into service that you you want to try out locally? So, this is one step. One step further in some sense.\nStevan Le Meur:  Once you have your game cluster, it appears as a container in your list of container. So I have it here in you. I can see the logs. And what's pretty interesting is that I can also directly from the here. I can also interact directly with a research there so I can Also, do a computer comment directly from the from here. So if I have my bud that I just create I can say, Hey, I want to deploy. That bird onto my chemical stuff so it's you use a superman coming to generate the Kubernetes manifests.\n00:35:00\nStevan Le Meur:  And and then it selects the Kubernetes context and I can do the deployment. Of my bud directly on tour. Onto my calendar. So share, it's probably pulling the image and now engine is running and I can see my part running locally in Batman, but I can also see it running on Kubernetes kind of stuff here as well. So this has a type of workflow that you you can leverage to make make it easier for you to have your turn around and you to test your application. More easier. As well.\nStevan Le Meur:  Coming with the version 1.0 we have a set of of extensions as you know, Batman Desktop. He's a, he's a it's open to multiple container online and Kubernetes distributions so that's compatibility with with the care Lima and for Kubernetes, we have integrated kind. But there's also the ability to run Openshift on your local developer environment. So you you can directly install the extension from from the screen. And once you have the application, the extension installed you can trade. An open shift, local environment. So I already have one. So, It's not going to.\nStevan Le Meur:  Turn that you have the ability to configure your bunch of local with two different presets. So either you can use an open shift, local an open shift, single cluster single note, cluster on your local environment. Or you can also use a lightweight version of Openshift which is micro shift that you can run you locally. So this is what I am running. Here and you obviously ability to switch your Kubernetes context from gain. To Microshift. So, if I have An image that I want to deploy to Microshift. I can also do that directly from on the list of images. And I can.\nStevan Le Meur:  Deploy. I can deploy you. Birds, I can deploy Kubernetes cmls directly onto a main micro shifter environment. We also integrated the capabilities for enabling the Docker compatibility mode. So this enable to map the docker circuit directly to to put men, but also use the command lines, that some developers may already be familiar with. So this is prettier pretty as well. So, it's available.\nStevan Le Meur:  Today it's free. You can download it from a ferment desktop dota you open man.io. As well. And we are always looking for feedback and you new new ideas on things that we could be. We could be improving. So feel free to engage on the requisitory as well, so you can create issues. And you can also report feedbacks directly from within the application so you can share your experience. And tell us, what are your suggestions as well.\nStevan Le Meur:  And with this, I think. I covered.\nStevan Le Meur:  The Intel. On Badman Desktop 1.0. So the lunch was two weeks ago, we have been getting a very positive Feedback from from the community. We had a lot of blog posts and the media coverage but there is also\n00:40:00\nStevan Le Meur:  Really announcements that we are. We published on a developers that had that come. So feel free to to give you to give a look, if you are interested, otherwise looking for hearing you your feedback and your thoughts. On the product.\nStevan Le Meur:  Any questions?\nTom Sweeney: Another question but would you share the department.io site real quick? It's the fun. Yeah, just for a moment,\u2026\nStevan Le Meur:  Sure.\nTom Sweeney: I just did want to mention that we have Mole here and That has been revamped greatly by her and other folks and it's looking phenomenal right now.\nStevan Le Meur:  Yeah, it's the new website is looking fantastic. So kudos to to move what's been working on this quite easily and it's it's I think what Batman was deserving so, really cool to see.\nTom Sweeney: Yes, thank you. And thank you once again. Well, it really is great. all right, that we're going to move on to Lokesh talking about Paul man, shakes\nLokesh Mandvekar: All right, let me share my screen. Stevan, could you stop showings\nStevan Le Meur: Sure.\nLokesh Mandvekar:  Well.\nLokesh Mandvekar:  All right, I guess you can see my screen. Oh, all right, so first off, what's the problem at hand? So as a system administrator, I would like to confine each user to a predefined show environment and in that environment a user would have access to volumes and capabilities specify for that particular user. Now, what is Plug-inch? Odman SH is an executable user been augments h along with a container by the same name. I'm going to search now. This container is managed by a user quadley. With the login shell, set to the plug-in SH executable. When the user logs into the system, they enter the podmanus H container directly. Now, let me do a quick demo. So first, let's check the current user is\nLokesh Mandvekar:  So that's the current user with the show set to bin Dash. Now I have created a demo user for this purpose. Now, this demo user has shell set to User bin podmanish. Also, with the user quadlet created for this demo user.\nLokesh Mandvekar:  Books.\nLokesh Mandvekar:  So this is a basic quadlet that's been created for the user. The image has been sent to Ubi-9 minimal. Now, let me first. See what posts I'm on. I'm on Fedora released 38. Now, I'll ssh into the system as gonna be user.\nLokesh Mandvekar:  Okay. so I'm ssh in and as the user demo,\nLokesh Mandvekar:  Environment is a real environment. As was specified in the bottled file. So, current status of this work, this is still working progress. There is an open PR, I'll link to it in Hack MD. Now this might get into 4.6, as a tech preview, but it should be ready for the release after 4.6. And that's my demo questions.\nTom Sweeney: Not hearing things.\nLokesh Mandvekar:  All right. Yeah, Tom back to you.\nTom Sweeney: Right, Lokesh. Thank you. That's great. And Matt, do you want to give us a quick rundown? What's happening with four or five?\nMatt Heon: I honestly I think I'll just take the opportunity to go on to four six and future release plans because four five is, this point is two months old. so,\n00:45:00\nTom Sweeney: What?\nMatt Heon:  Generally speaking, we are planning at least, one more release this summer, but there's still discussion going on in the team as to whether we're going to do two one end of this month and one somewhere in August, or just, just one release, which would be probably mid to late July. So we're not completely sure on this, but you were getting at least a four six and potentially a four seven by end of summer, we're hoping to firm this up and get an actual document out that will describe future release cadence at some point, but that's still being worked on as to what you can expect. And for six generally speaking improvements to podman machine, especially around Mac, and Windows improvements to quadlet and just general bevy of bug fixes that you usually gets also at some point, maybe not for six, but some point the future we are going to be making the new SQLite database back and the\nMatt Heon:  Fault, still needs to be discussed if it's mature enough to do that and four, six. This should be only for new installation. So I don't expect any significant changes from user perspective, but that is something to look out for. And I think that's about it. I could go into four or five features again it's two months old and at our current cadence, that is a agent history.\nTom Sweeney: Now, that's fine by me. Brent, did you have anything to say? You look like you had something you wanted to sing?\nBrent Baude: You know, no, but I can add to it. We're currently just sort of looking at\u2026\nTom Sweeney:  Okay.\nBrent Baude: what we're working on where Matt hit a lot of it. We're working on some final pieces for Netta Mark. Parody with CNI. And in terms of machine,\nBrent Baude:  But I currently have two new hypervisors in flight. And one is Hyper-V. For windows. And the second is the apple hypervisor their native, one rather than c** you. Both are progressing nicely. Because their new platforms. For fedora coros, it does have to go through a rather. lengthy process and get into their release process, to where images would be automatically created.\nBrent Baude: On. But a lot of that code will be in four six and potentially for those chomping at the bit they can Check out if it fixes or solves any problems one. Very good thing. I'm happy to report is we have hurt Ilfs, working on the apple, Hypervisor part and it's quite fast.\nBrent Baude:  I think that's it, Matt.\nMatt Heon: Yeah, science about right to me.\nBrent Baude: yes, of course, Stephen\nStevan Le Meur: you yeah, wanted to ask if you if you are looking for people who want to test, the the work on the I Native I advisors If you are seeking for, for more testers from the community here, I'm not yet.\nBrent Baude: I will but not yet on the hyper V side.\nStevan Le Meur:  Okay.\nBrent Baude:  We need we need ignition upstream to merge, and start creating some images. I could do one offs, but it's not something I like to do. The second piece is the\nBrent Baude:  socket mapping. For Hyper-V is not been completed.\nBrent Baude:  So, it would make it. More difficult for people to actually use in that regard on the habitable. On the apple side, we're still working out. I'm actually sort of faking out ignition right now, and that's how I'm doing the testing. But we're we're basically saying thing there, no socket mapping yet and we need mission to Merge when it works done.\nBrent Baude:  And I'm going fishing next week, so it won't be in the next week.\nTom Sweeney: Don't catch any Celtics, please.\n00:50:00\nTom Sweeney:  All right, that's it for our plan topics. We have just a few minutes left for open form. Questions, does anybody have any questions or comments? They want to make\nBrent Baude: We love to hear what we're not doing, right?\nTom Sweeney:  yes. And also any topics that you'd like to see for the next meeting. Which I'll just say real quickly. Our next meeting is August 1st 2023. That's a Tuesday. That's first Tuesday of August, that'll be at 11:00 am again in our next ball. Meetings back up on me because you do that on the third floor you stay at the month and that's on the 15th this time around. So that'll be next Thursday. So, if you have any topics for either of those, let me know currently the quality demo will be on that list for the community meeting New August.\nTom Sweeney: I'm not hearing any other questions comments.\nStevan Le Meur: Comments. I think it's super cool. Everything that is happening in the Comet Padman community at the moment. So thanks everyone for your engagement involvement.\nTom Sweeney: All this.\nStevan Le Meur: It's amazing.\nTom Sweeney:  this, it's been\nGerry Seidman: actually, if I can at the 11th hour, ask questions, I actually met with Ben\u2026\nTom Sweeney:  there.\nGerry Seidman: At Red Hat Summit and he's very aware of this stuff we're doing with a major financial that very much wants ALS if you would be ultimate layer storage. kind of,\nGerry Seidman: Whatever dancing. Just I presented the group on it, I won't be able to, I don't know if I'll put on the 15th, but what's one after the 15th, what the meeting date after the 15th?\nTom Sweeney: um, the one is there's Department of Community meeting on August 1st with this. Another one, another Cabal meeting. And if I can get my calendar up, I tell you, it's the third Thursday, in July. You don't?\nGerry Seidman: Right. Well, I'll reach out to you, then send an email between you and I, I'll follow up on that. Um, really\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Okay.\nGerry Seidman: what I would, what my curiosity is, is right now. The ALF is considered experimental and storage in the container storage. Any suggestions on decide what the things I talked with Dan about about, Moving it forward to. Not being experimental.\nGerry Seidman: Like documentation. Things like that.\nTom Sweeney: Right? Can I throw that one in your life?\nBrent Baude: Yeah, I was just waiting to see if anyone piped up. So Gerry you're the one then.\nGerry Seidman: I'm the one if you've heard about the people thinking about it. Yeah.\nBrent Baude:  I heard about him.\nBrent Baude:  I guess for content. I'd have to think about that. It's an interesting question. What is I'm not deeply familiar with what's held it back? Other than the fact that it's fairly new, but not a new technology, but a new ad.\nGerry Seidman: Yeah, it's it's it's deployed, it works. In the, you know, it's it's Dan suggested Da edit, you know, submitting some documentation. The only place I could imagine to document that is in the Storage.com. Man Page because nothing, there's no commands associated with it. Maybe you have some other thoughts in that. I've written that up. I just haven't submitted it yet. um, It works.\nBrent Baude: Okay.\nGerry Seidman: Um, it's really just a matter of fear of commitment.\nGerry Seidman:  because, Other than myself, a group of NT.\nGerry Seidman:  And then some other miscellaneous projects, I don't think anybody, I don't know how many people using it.\nBrent Baude: let me, let me get back to you, but I wondered if there were You said there was documentation and container storage.\nGerry Seidman: Now there's there is not, I I wrote some up that I can submit and\u2026\nBrent Baude:  Oh, okay. Okay.\nGerry Seidman: it really just I mean if you the other technology is the, you know, the alternate image store and that literally has two lines of documentation. I wrote A couple of paragraphs, which is probably too much but\nBrent Baude: Well regardless that would be good to have.\nBrent Baude:  I think, beginning the blog about it would be smart it and we can provide a blogging resource if you're interested.\nGerry Seidman:  Yeah, that's good to that but if you do you have my cut contact information?\nBrent Baude:  Yeah, it's in the calendar notice, I would assume.\nGerry Seidman:  okay, so I don't have your contact information, so if you could ping me out response, thank you.\nBrent Baude:  Absolutely.\n00:55:00\nTom Sweeney: Right. Folks, unless there's any last questions. We're almost a time for this meeting. I'd like to very much thank all the presenters today for coming in and showing off the substance of fascinating. Look for a lot of things today. And again, we'll be meeting next on August 1st and then on July 20th. June 15th and July 20th. But I'm gonna stop the recording.\nTom Sweeney: And anybody wants to say anything and not be recorded. Otherwise, let's go to lunch.\nStevan Le Meur: Boost.\nGerry Seidman: In 30 days.\nTom Sweeney: All right, folks. Have a great day. Thanks so much.\nMeeting ended after 00:56:17 \ud83d\udc4b\n")))}hi.isMDXComponent=!0;const di={},ui="Podman Community Cabal Meeting Notes",mi=[{value:"June 15, 2023 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-5)",id:"june-15-2023-1100-am-eastern-utc-5",level:2},{value:"Attendees:",id:"attendees",level:2},{value:"June 15, 2023 Topics",id:"june-15-2023-topics",level:2},{value:"Meeting Notes",id:"meeting-notes",level:3},{value:"Additional Layer Storage (ALS) (0:57 in the video) -

This is the Podman Community Cabal meeting. We'll be talking today about additional layer storage and we have Gerry's. I'm going to mess up your name. Jerry, is it Seidman?\nGerry Seidman: But I've been seidman. Yep.\nTom Sweeney: Seidman, And then after that we've got to talk that's kind of a generic talk. For Ipfs integration into Pod, Anders was going to delete at least take that off. I don't see offers. Yeah, so we'll see. And I know Dan had wanted to talk about that as well. And so I have hack MD set up where I'll be taking the notes today. If you have links or anything that you want to add to it or if you find that I've just described something in the notes, feel free to go ahead and change those as you see fit. And with all that, I'm gonna hand it over to Gerry's. Thanks for coming today. I'm not sure.\nGerry Seidman: somebody could just check the fact that works that Could be my presentation's life. if not, \u2026\nDaniel Walsh: He?\nGerry Seidman: because some people like to follow along and as PDF, I could have put them there. That's a good point. Right.\nGerry Seidman: Nobody's going to confirm or deny.\nTom Sweeney: While I was muted, which was very helpful. It's no like not.\nGerry Seidman: Did you get it?\nTom Sweeney: It says I need access. Question.\nGerry Seidman: All right, hold on. Anyone with the link? Not let me do it again.\nDaniel Walsh: and I was now we said, Yep.\nGerry Seidman: Got it. Excellent because you don't make it easier for everybody because I'm going to talk fast. I'm from New York and I have too many flights. so hi. I'm Gerry Seidman. I'm president or a store which is a company that has a security distributed file system. I'm going to talk about our core product and also going to talk about what we're doing the container space or doing for accelerating.\nTom Sweeney: Who's Gerry now?\nEd Santiago Munoz: Very immuted.\nDaniel Walsh: Gerrymuted.\nDaniel Walsh: I see infinity.\nGerry Seidman: All right. Can somebody now say, Yes Gerry. I fear flies and I hear you\nDaniel Walsh: Yes Gerry. I see your slides and\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Yes.\nDaniel Walsh: I hear you.\nGerry Seidman: Nobody. You.\nDaniel Walsh: Yes.\nTom Sweeney: we can hear you.\nGerry Seidman: Can you hear me? So I can't hear you for some reasons, but that's okay. If you have any questions. I'll jump out.\nGerry Seidman: I've got it. All right, so I'm gonna go very quickly through a lot of topics. What I'm going to talk about what is Orest or FS. I'm gonna fake frame, the problem that\nGerry Seidman: The ores will container Accelerator solves. I'm going to very very quickly talk about container storage internals which most of you should know better than me. I'm gonna talk about additional image or which Dan certainly knows better than me. Then I'm gonna talk about additional layer stores, that's a typo,\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Technology.\nGerry Seidman: It should be additional layer Stores, storage, and then finally, I'm going to talk about the order here accelerator Actually, I'm going to be talking about that interest first with a bunch of other stuff and specific to it. So our surprise the cloud process for the 21st century that's actually a joke because the orchestra file system has its roots in the Andrew file system, which predates NFS it was designed.\nGerry Seidman: Very presciently. but the reason or what our stores initial funding came from the Department of Energy and we got an SDAR to create a 21st Century Cloud file system that extends upon the AFS vision. so that's the joke in that. but it was designed to do a lot of things store on extends very much beyond what the open source AFS does and certainly what anybody who's AFS a long time ago, might\n00:05:00\nGerry Seidman: Remember but here's the kind of the high level points and I'm going to drill into some of them, A true global namespace on that actually can span organizations not just clouds access transparent. It's just a processing files again for definition. In this case, I'm talking about the part of the file system, Not block storage. it's highly secure. I'm not going to go into the security model at all, into the catch consistency model. What that means is that, There is a local cash on that, on the machine, on each client. And if something changes in the server, it's the server's responsibility to inform the client, which means to do polling because it's done properly. Little version has the things like that. The cash actually survives a regal.\nGerry Seidman: if platform independent, the clients were on pretty much everything. I'm going to talk more about I'm going to talk about evidence, volume separately, high availability works well over the win as well as the land boundless scalability and like I said, hybrid multicloud by default. I'm just focus for a minute on these because they're just what I mean by a global namespace is if you just take a fresh install of the Dora and anything over for 31, There's a bug answer 38. But if you do a fresh install you LS slash AFS there's nothing there you install the cast client, there's an upstream when it's client that's in the main clean line, as well as in many distributions like we're going to not yet in route but we have a fine version if you're running around.\nGerry Seidman: 9.2 Ask reach out to me and I can give you this client. you just start the afs.mount service. And then if you're running there's a bug integer at 38 where you have to stand in first, permissive you don't into door up 37 and you won't or 39 and hopefully not much longer 38.\nGerry Seidman: And then just believe you're an astrophysicist or a high energy businesses and just look at files concern, LS slash AFS last cern.ch and lo and behold it works. Zero client configuration global management. Access transparent. It just looks like a file. So I'm going to just add a file from Cerns Atlas Project. Let's go from their aspected and it just work and as I said, it's platform, independent, on the one side of windows and the other side of women. I'm going to focus on the parts that are salient for ALS, the cash consistency model and the answer findings of policy containers really more than about the air that's fine in AFS again,\u2026\nTom Sweeney: He?\nGerry Seidman: volume is highly overloaded term in AFS and abiding. It's just a rooted directory of, files And it can have, files and sim links and directories etc. an example of a volume rewrite volumes would be, for example, painting data, machine learning training that a lot models data sets application binaries, configuration files, static Web content for write, your home, directory Scratch, space log but some specific project etc.\nGerry Seidman: Volumes are the unit of management and It's the thing, you put policy upon things like quota replicas. So for example, if that's where I want high availability, I might serve it up on three fosterers in New York in Shanghai One in London. It's still globally accessible, but your client will find a closest one to get you the best performance. maximal access controls, the security thing things that you can do things like this data. Can't be the US. It's got a lot of cool stuff, but an AFS volume and the AF unit of management is called Estelle and cells have volumes in them and volumes have human readable names. so for example I could have a volume called Language Model DOT training DASH data.\nGerry Seidman: so that would be where I would put it. I didn't say that access it yet and there's also a special volume with the name Root that again there's volumes. I don't know why I have a separate. you miss, what I'm showing is that within an FS volume, you can link to another amp as volume as if you triangle are for\n00:10:00\nGerry Seidman: Yeah, the triangles are showing, you can actually have hard links, you've actually have hard links as well as SIM links within a volume. You can't do hard length. but you can do mount points of the volumes. so how are you access it in? actually gave you This is the syntax not for cast but for our proprietary client but anybody can reach out, tell you how to do it or look up online. Mount Slash cell volume name gets you to a volume. That just works. There's also a dynamic route, /, By default. It could be anything else in your system. it doesn't have a lot of our banking customers, have it.\nGerry Seidman: Only locally accessible on and that's how the global names So I'll get back to that with an example. But for example, somewhere on my file system, I might want to have my, chat ABC language training data. I want to mount it there. So I just say I could do L / blah blah\u2026\nTom Sweeney: it's\nGerry Seidman: because slash that out. / myog.com, Bush language, training directly gets me to the root of that volume. So if I link it to be there, I now have it anywhere my file system. again, that's the syntax of here, but one of the cool things is dynamic, zero, configuration Global namespace. So there is that I mentioned in passing, a slash AFS directly off of the route. That's now actually reserve name. You can't. It's\nGerry Seidman: Its official things slash AFS you can't have such anything, and the way it works, if I go AFS slash you michigan.edu or cern.edu, There are DNS service records that say, where the metadata servers are for University of Michigan or certain etc. And what happens is the client, when you say slash afs/stern.com, it goes to DNS and it finds the IP address of the metadata server. And then it dynamically mounts, the route that sell special fruit. I\nGerry Seidman: Last say the penultimate thing I want to say is afs Everything was, really, an object store. It's not really a false, Server. It's an object server where each volume is an object store and each entity in it files, links, directories etc, are objects with their unique guys object IDs. And actually the server doesn't know anything about paths, unlike NFS. the path is all the pathwork, Interpretation is always done, completely on the client.\nGerry Seidman: As I said, also said there's a cash consistency model that survives reboot so when you read from the file server, a fraction of not a copy and sync file system. it just grabs the block that you read, it stores in the cash or the least presentation you use caching on and the cash can be very very large. couple gigabytes would be a couple of terrified. So for example you doing the machine learning Up. You might want to have a very large cache. so \u2026\nTom Sweeney: Traditionals.\nGerry Seidman: point basically networks over All right, that's all we know are all experts in or restore. now I talk a little bit about containers of software,\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Gerry.\nGerry Seidman: deployment, inheriting, all the classic problems of software delivery. very quick slide. Just we all know this that at runtime you're using, you've got an overlay file system the presented to the run container at runtime where the route is the write layer. And then there's a list of We don't get players. On the local machine, if you built. A container with a bunch of layers, you have all the files locally in particular, you also have a manifest that are config file. Whatever, those are well dependent,\nGerry Seidman: it's just helps me about the container image. But when you say top, I've been push. It takes those files on the layers and creates a car.tz compressed version. And that's what goes up to the container registry, and the container regency stores them. And in fact, the container registry is basically an object store where the manifest even a io slash\n00:15:00\nGerry Seidman: Out library slash alpine, you go to the registry and say Hey, what's its unique ID? What's the idea of its manifest? That's the only time you used, It's not object like And then from there on you just bootstrap and say Give you the man give you this object ID which is the manifest. They give me this object Died ID with coming in the manifest, the layer ID to grab the layers. and when you say Pull you do the opposite, you pull the layers and you untar them locally onto your local disk. so what are the associated costs with pulling a container? There's the clock time spent downloading the entire car.g file, which for large files, can be not insignificant that the cost of the network bandwidth.\nGerry Seidman: but if any CPU and IO spent expanding, that's hard on TV onto locales and the disk space required to store them and expand them. So effectively your container start time is the download time plus the expansion time and again these costs are only incurred the first time to container the layers full I say container image but it's per large container. Images are not uncommon. Icon is 1.1 gigabyte. Before you do anything, we have I know of customers that have just taken. Legacy systems and made them into one. Giant could 40 gigabyte Container. and then an example of that would be SAS. If you remember the old statistics programs is? Yes. That's what they did. They're not a customer bars but they have one I think there's 50 or 60 gigabytes. They just\nGerry Seidman: Big one, giant container image big deal. I'm only downloading it once no problems. So if I got a one gigabyte app, I download it to my machine or my server. I got the problem is a scale this adds up. So if I'm deploying a thousand one gigabyte images to a thousand machine a thousand. And they say, if I'm delivering a single gigabyte image to a thousand machine, that means I've got to move a terabyte over my network. which is you don't ever want to start a thing with a terabyte over your network and certainly, if you're in any industry where the network has to be really, Smooth like a bank anything is doing experimentation on it. you don't want that choppiness of the network caused by a lot of pulling of images on. And again, we're running a thousand machines is an uncommon. I mean, we have enterprise customers that are running on\nGerry Seidman: It actually running applications almost 200,000 machines. Tens of thousands of applications not uncommon for a single application, to go to a thousand machines and then we just drifted across the enterprise both locally and globally and cross-cloud. So that's not uncommon and we also have customers that have HPC compute clusters, where they got a thousand nodes and they'll just, blow out the container image To the notes in the classroom so It's not unrealistic. The other thing is that if you're running lots of containers at a single machine either individually with pod man or orchestrated by a Kubernetes, you can have a lot of containers in the machine and that actually causes a bloat in the disc\nGerry Seidman: just by the way. there's the Pie Man Group, an open ship node if you configured it with a bunch of stuff. Turned on can be up to 100 gigabytes of operator interview. So when you're creating a new openshift node, you could be pulling as much as a hundred gigabytes of container images and there are many as factors in the time but it takes about 45 minutes of setup and openshift note. so okay, so now we know, can we take as bad? their respects. so an important observation and this actually goes back, is this software delivery crop, there's over deployment problem goes back to cards, and tapes, and discs, and CDs, and RPM files. and containers, that many of the files in this offer deployment, and the container image are just not used.\nGerry Seidman: They're just not used. unless somebody put a lot of work into calling their deployment. Pretty bloated. In fact, going back to a paper on back in 2016. There's link by harder.\n00:20:00\nGerry Seidman: Pulling packages accounts, for 76% of containers, start time, but only six, four percent of that data is great. That was the result of Studies their analysis over the three years ago but I suspect it's worse, not better. But There you go. So in that prior example, if I'm pushing a thousand copies of a container to, a one gig by tonight near to a thousand machines that one terabyte would go down to 6.4.\nGerry Seidman: And there's a local dishes, reduction of storage actually for more than six for more because the carballs expand again for a single image. It's not important. But I've got a machine with many images, I could have hundreds and they have hundreds of gigabytes of Actively use container images on it on a server or a coin Tom, I'm not going to dwell on this. This is from that 2006 paper, about some example slides, let me go back, What was their research was fast, distribution of lazy doctor containers, and they had this idea that if you could create an index into the target, the file you just cherry pick the\nGerry Seidman: Blocks of the Tar of the blob using HTTP get range instead of just HTTP, get all from the tainer registry. and so, their whole paper is about creating indices and creating these non -standard container images. so this is from there.\nGerry Seidman: There, non-standard implementation, but still they're getting pretty impressive, compressions and pretty significant. Start time improvement. again because it's only pulling down the files that are actually used as runtime. Or so let's not take another digression on container storage. because then this will all come together because My feeling is, never.\nGerry Seidman: Never use a technology. You don't know how to write. So I'm basically going into the internals of you understand how it works in that way? Hopefully everything is clear, container storage. again, This is talking to the choir, he's acquire or I am preaching, that you've got the storage on configuration file storage at Conf file. and then you have a local working directly where the container layers and images information stored on and at those respective paths, this is all implemented in the Storage containers slash image, subsystems,\nGerry Seidman: Just for laughs, I'm just starting with a fresh system I say podman images. And what that does is that actually populates the empty graph of the structure. I can teach drove into everything but that's the kind of the structure of storage in Edwin time with pod man. And if I look at it, when I just created empty, it's about 32k, all right. we're only going to focus on again, in these slides, the things in green are the things remind myself to talk about. There's the overall a storage and that's the storage slash over. that's what the actual files are stored for the layers and images. It's where Information about the images. is stored because again, a layer may be used by multiple image just\nGerry Seidman: All So again doing something simple like a dot pod man poll, it gives us a throws out this number which is the the layer digest of a layer outside the single layer container. this every day I'm saying works on multi-layer containers. It cools down the manifest file and then it copy signature and it goes back the id of the registry, the idea of con that's a digest of the container image and justice. So we'll see these numbers again is 31. is the layer C1, aabv is the looking inside the overlay images file. We see bear again.\n00:25:00\nGerry Seidman: Corresponding to the image ID of C1a. There's a self-direct you c1a with junk under it, but it does include the manifest file and the way you find the Sea 31 e35. that's the actually manifest ID. The digest of the compressed image, not the uncompressed image, which is actually what's used in the manifest file. so the way to find the Actual digest, that layer is doing stuff.\nGerry Seidman: But extracting stuff out of the JSON bucket advo, again, I'm not going to talk it through, but the point of making is that you cannot forget about the 31 e blah blah, because it maps to one to the seven, a 78, 8 blah blah, but we're gonna want. Again let's look at the overlay folder, we see the bear lo and behold is a directly corresponding to that layer. With some files, the saline file being the diff file which contains the files from that layer and I can go directly and see those fun. All right, so we're now and then it run time.\nGerry Seidman: Everyone at runtime. You need a we'll see a second, container layers created. That's the transient regular layer of this container. when the container ends and you remove, podman RM. that layer will go away but I just want to, be clear that I run the container and break some content in it. I can see it actually under over All right. So now We all probably were experts on this before I started talking, but now we're reminded experts. so now we're talking about an additional image store and I'm additional image store, briefly on Alicia Image Store, allows you to have multiple instances of that structure that I just talked about. and\nGerry Seidman: you specify and you have one or more of those. And those are configured in the storage. I can't follow under additional image stores. and what it worked exactly like when you do a poll it looks like any pull, but you pull into a specified copy. So you have actually that directly structure multiple times in multiple plates. All right, depending on how many you have. And so if I pull busy box into that and then I go into that directly the temp slash ais. You'll see lo and behold, I get exactly what I saw before. but the AIS will only be read only. You will never ever be, it's only for the images, the layers from\nGerry Seidman: Downloaded Images. The rewrite layers at runtime, it will always put the rebite layer in your primary route. But notice, I left something out. I just want to be very clear When I ran Alpine 7.5 megabytes just remember that number 7.5, megabytes is the size of alpine, busy boxes smaller, 4.8 megabytes. and when you do a podman images, you have an extra column with them additional restore which will tell you whether it's your store it's coming from whatever you read, only layer stores.\nGerry Seidman: so what's the value, proposition of this, you get to share only layers across multiple users. for example, if the alternate image stores is on a single box, as you know, that in podman root was podman, every user has their own directly structure. Corresponding to storage on digital, allow you to have a single place rather than having every user on a machine. Downloading, the image, they can get from a shared place. another use case is you downloaded into an NSF share. And now, you have files that are being called on your local machine from an NFS share. And so instead of having copies on every machine, you have a copies just share all of this because of the whole into the alternative.\n00:30:00\nGerry Seidman: Image store, it has to be administrative managed. Somebody's got to do something to do that, whether to do the Poland locally of the pull, into the end of the share, on if you haven't read it. There's Daniel Walsh's is article on exploring additional image tours in climate. So the bottom line is part, man, works pretty much to me. Additionally, the creamers standard. It's just allows to have more than one. Let's have extra real now to be contrasted with additional layer store. ALS.\nGerry Seidman: It would, the history of ALS goes back to that harder paper where they tried to create As I said, a way to lazy load containers by having an index into a GC file That's what the essence seekable tar tzus. But that stands for, and that's what they did. I'm not gonna dwell in it. But, the original approves, the concept for ALS was done by a group of NTT engineers, who did the heavy lifting of\nGerry Seidman: Implementing what the harder group did but in actually container slash images just in compares my storage as well as in container d. and it is now shipped. it is in padman today so, ALS provides or additional sources of layer content not about the whole structure of the storage. It's just A layer content on there are actually three examples of uses of ALS the star GC. The NTT one serum I think has one, but I think they may have walked away from it. There's an ipfs implementation, of course,\nGerry Seidman: so, the way you implement ALS is with a fuse driver on because you need some sort of RPC from the container runtime, to say, Hey, I need the thought content of the layer. Can you provide it? It's really what happens at runtime right? But before down do I have the files locally? it says Hey you use file system. Can you provide? And you specify the root of your ALS file system under additional layer stores in the configuration problem.\nGerry Seidman: And so what happens is at runtime, there's an intercept. if it doesn't already have the files, it asks, can you do it? And if you're also says, yes, It's okay, great. Give me your route and I'll get the files from you. we'll see a little bit more details. Don't here. So, in this example I have my Orestore ultimately stored fruit at Chiliary Slash Home slash Store by putting that in your config file. It's telling the container runtime to look\nGerry Seidman: We don't want to query you, it uses the fuses according language, it's kind of an RPC, your future, lash your ALS root slash the basically form of the image Layer Digest. And that's where it's expecting. You to provide. a different directory, as well as some info and info file and the RAW blog if it asks you for it never does. But alright. So again you have to satisfy the ALS RPC by being able to service these paths.\nGerry Seidman: But these paths by your driver. So let's look again. So here's the same thing. I did I have a blank fresh banana storage, the 32k. I do it with my ALS driver running. I saw a problem Paul, everything's the same. And now I look into a dis usage on it, and instead of being 7.5 megabytes, it's 1.4 kilometers. And 104 kilobyte and that's not going to change. The caching is done on AFS. That cash is any different place. so in this case we reduce the container storage size by quite a lot. And the interesting thing is, when I did this Dr. Paul nothing came over the network.\n00:35:00\nGerry Seidman: All that happened was the ALS driver, said I can provide the services. I can provide the file. You didn't answer any file. So I'm not doing anything yet but I'm saying, I can if you false at those directories. So now let's look in the store for that's actually overlay. no this is the ALS route. what my fuse Paul system is providing and my priest is a root with the base 64 encoding of I guess that's io / Alpine. Or something like that, the digest of the layer. And I have to provide.\nGerry Seidman: Basic people of the reference slash died, layer digest, slash Bob /, stiff /, info and doing a little forward. Think notice that, what am I doing in my Orestore? They also implementation. I am I'm just doing a link to a volume on the cell DVD that I mx.com blah blah. Coincidentally with the name, very similar. I'm truncating, the names just for you either use and again just to prove I did an echo of that z blah blah through based 64 decode and yes in fact it is / liver.\nGerry Seidman: going back to container storage. what I'm seeing is that A Digest ID, I see. Under the death rather than the files which I saw before. I just see a symbolic link. again, I did that's what it really is but below I kind of abbreviated so The Overlay slash Layer Digest. Glitch GIF is really a symbolic into that AFS about into that path, which in fact is Going to give you the content of the day ARS or volume.\nGerry Seidman: And I'm just kind of showing you that really works on the slash info just gives you a standard information of the information of that layer. That's a image standard. and if I do a stat - l of the blob file, it says that in fact, if Laos driver can give you the part of the file of that, layer, and it's gonna be three point four, 3.4 mega. and of course, if I run the end and if I just run it, everything runs as normal. So again, the only, I ran this and the storage size, one from seven point five megabytes, a hundred, and four kilobytes.\nGerry Seidman: So that's the trick behind ALS to be many. You can put NFS behind Ali but if the fundamental difference in ALS and AIS, is that, as has a complete replication of that complicated structure, which allows us to reuse a lot of code, it's using the same code as container storage. But,\nGerry Seidman: but with ALS, you're just grabbing the layers on the Web. All right, so this is currently Deployed in pod, You can run it today in five, but if you look in this source code, it says Experimental. And if you look the band page for storage comp, there's no reference. So one of my missions is to get it promoted. and Dan suggested the following route, give a presentation of the pod, man. Cabal, this write a blog article about it.\n00:40:00\nGerry Seidman: Update the man pages to storage account.\nGerry Seidman: Describes additional layer store and makes them create some as a test. I can be run in the continuous integration, I think for the storage fiber. So finally, yes, there are some container accelerator. again, I really want to already All it is a fuse driver at runtime, it's a fuse driver. That maps, those munched names of lake of container image references slash layers to AF volume names in a well-defined manner. How is it configured? Actually look at this actually have in a cell\nGerry Seidman: I have this layer volume that file so actually that path is the same path. That I put in Assuming I'm sorry configuration storage account in the ALS client configuration, give it a path that they bootstrap I don't want Put information on I'm a distributed file system. I might as well have to configuration where it should be. and what that's saying is that The cell name ABC Direct ids.com will service layers.\nGerry Seidman: these are from these repos and you will find it in that cell under the layer name, J-1 Underscore Blah, where the blood and I strip out this shot to pick the same. so that's the mapping to find the air or volume, from from the image and Up. Why does it work where these layers coming from? There's a service called the oyster layer.\nGerry Seidman: Volume generation service that either can be hooked by a webhooks for your container registry or through. A command line tool where you say L V I'll be c Ingest docker.io slash Alpine and all it does does it goes to the container registry, it grabs the manifest? And then, for each of the DIP layers, it says, If I haven't already created an IFS volume corresponding to that in the appropriate cell. I download it and I untar it and then I create an Amazon volume with that. and so that's what the later generation service does, that's it. So now I'm gonna stop sharing and I think I was not too over and I haven't heard anything. So hopefully\nDaniel Walsh: Can you hear us now?\nGerry Seidman: Hopefully people here, it might get presentation. Good can't hear you.\nDaniel Walsh: Yes.\nGerry Seidman: Could somebody say something our speakers muted?\nDaniel Walsh: we're trying to talk, you can't\nGerry Seidman: No, they're not. Okay, so people are speaking. I'm gonna just\nDaniel Walsh: Can you hear us now?\nGerry Seidman: Okay. Tom. You raise his hands.\nGerry Seidman: Are you speaking time? And hold on a second,\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Can you hear anything? At all during\nGerry Seidman: I'm sorry.\nTom Sweeney: Can you check chat?\nTom Sweeney: And here's\nGerry Seidman: My Bluetooth. I'm having technology problems. I apologize.\nEd Santiago Munoz: first past,\nGerry Seidman: and so,\nTom Sweeney: I don't think he's on board yet. you can hear us. Okay.\nGerry Seidman: I can hear you now. Yeah, my Bluetooth. Down.\nGerry Seidman: Who knows all these screen sharing things do weird,\u2026\nTom Sweeney: I'll be.\nGerry Seidman: things that Bluetooth and it turns out the speakers on my laptop don't work. So I had to put an external speaker.\nTom Sweeney: Okay, so We do have a couple questions that were queued up while you were talking,\u2026\nGerry Seidman: I apologize.\nTom Sweeney: and we couldn't get your attention. So Chris had one that was can volume store extended attributes,\u2026\nGerry Seidman: Absolutely.\n00:45:00\nTom Sweeney: ie SE Linux labels\nGerry Seidman: extended attributes're currently not supported, they will be supported in the next release of our store. and I'm guessing you asked that because the overlay file system wants speaks so it turns out pod man is good Kubernet. Openshift is bad because POD Man default to fuse overlay at this. I refuse every AFS I can provide them the dot, the white app files But in the next version of Aura Store, we'll be able to do that. We're actually doing some other stuff. We're also doing verities checking and things like that which will make us the only just distributed file system that can do that. That's already if and when you care on etc.\nDaniel Walsh: Gerry. I asked Access control. Is that done on the server side,\u2026\nGerry Seidman: Yes. there,\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: or the client side?\nGerry Seidman: there's a problem. Ask the control of an interesting thing, because there's actually three different places where your Baptist control. You have the Unix bits that are in the container images. Those are preserved by container of the standard pipeline, there's the permission to download the layers on the container registry. And then there's the permission to access the AFS volume.\nGerry Seidman: All right, three different places We can restrict.\nGerry Seidman: A runtime application to access the files in an AFS volume. We can do that. We can put access control on the volume. We can't do it on the per file because I can't be worth that. Can't be represented, we actually can but it makes no sense in the whole container model. but if you would really want to do that, you would want to have a container registry that would never serve the product PZ.\nDaniel Walsh: yeah, yeah, because we've been in the past if I put stores on And network file store. For instance, NFS. It doesn't understand username space. So if I'm in using a space and I tried to chone a file, the service says, no because it doesn't want, UID the Walsh to Jones. Uid 100,000 Yeah.\nGerry Seidman: Got it. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think yeah, good.\nDaniel Walsh: I think it Would AFS work same way.\nGerry Seidman: And that's the book. No, I guess would work. I don't,\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: What?\nGerry Seidman: I don't know why it's out of my pay grade but if I \u2026\nDaniel Walsh: So, you think Andrew would allow that?\nGerry Seidman: I believe. So I could run a quick check, but I believe it does. But take that as a qualified. Yes.\nDaniel Walsh: All right, so yeah, when you were showing the additional layer store, you have a tool.\nGerry Seidman: And hopefully, I'll play it in this representational image store.\nDaniel Walsh: No, no additional. But I liked a lot of lights and it'd probably be helpful. If we got some of those slides up to basically describe all this stuff all works the ALS Though.\nGerry Seidman: Every.\nDaniel Walsh: You say there's a fuse file system that's required, we is that fuse file system open source at this point.\nGerry Seidman: It's an implementation specific thing, the start the MTT one, the star gz one is the orcer.\nDaniel Walsh: Right. Okay.\nGerry Seidman: One is not but\nGerry Seidman: It's a Long story. As to why or store is not open source? We'd love to be.\nDaniel Walsh: Right.\nGerry Seidman: We just can't eat and build in source.\nDaniel Walsh: That's fine. So, you have a tool that is creating these additional layer stores.\nDaniel Walsh: in a format that we can get some to buy making consume. Hi.\nGerry Seidman: Yep.\nGerry Seidman: Yeah, yeah, I think it's that the image layer digest to layer, the orcer layer volume. Configuration is, this is shared by the server and the service that creates them as well as the client. yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: and lastly, the\nGerry Seidman: Anything and there's a little thing I want it. Also mentioned Big organizations that have a lot of apps over. A lot of time have a lot of problems with Cullen. when when you call something and our customers are always asking what can we do to help and it's not a lot we can do to help because you can only at best in for certain things, but and the container images you have this an even worse problem because you are Ask you be, cashed far away, and have it for a long time. And so we posited that we could get some some users metrics from our ALS drunk from our fuse driver. Of the weather layers are being used, would you?\n00:50:00\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah. So if he had a layer that has been used in three years that you can get rid of it.\nGerry Seidman: Right. Exactly.\nDaniel Walsh: other questions, anybody?\nDaniel Walsh: So, why would you prefer to use ALS rather than just doing? Ais.\nGerry Seidman: This. One is the dynamic nature of it that there's no pull. The other with. Areas is, I would have to figure out how to do it. Because I'm mapping, I'd have to do something in image store, to do From. The appropriate path where ALS jumps off. where was storage? as it's just the standard storage, overlay slash blah. I don't know how I would even look into that without doing some. Plumbing. In story. Right.\nDaniel Walsh: I guess, lastly, the reason've people have said they won't use Ais in the past has been laden. so that you're running a container, it's running fine for a long period of time and\u2026\nGerry Seidman: Okay.\nDaniel Walsh: then all of a sudden decides to access some piece of data that is in cash. And It goes into a pause.\nGerry Seidman: Yeah, I mean but yes the answer is one of the events of a alsover. Over AIS in that regard is the cash. If you hit something, you haven't hit the long time. it may still be in the cash for the NFS. You're always doing it whether you voted it recently or not. Could be cashing is much.\nGerry Seidman: And not as good. which,\nGerry Seidman: and one of the things they did in East RG, the Star Gz project which we have talked about doing as well to That problem is to create a manifest of files to pull the pold to populate to feed the cash. When I was at Redhead Summit, I spoke extensively with somebody who works as a cruise line and a ship is one giant. Open ship cluster. And they have a lot of pain bouncing that off of a satellite network. That's extensive and slow and loss and unreliable.\nGerry Seidman: So to meet their needs, we talked about adding functionality of, like I said, a seat a seed, set of these are files, you should preload and those can be obtained by observing fire runs of the application on. That's already implemented again in Star Gz, You look at there's a way to somehow I forget how but somehow specify however how to pre-pull Anyway this is funny because it sounds the fast start but by default it then lazy loads the whole image. So you're going to fast start, but eventually you have all the fossils.\nTom Sweeney: Okay, I'm gonna have to hold questions here because we are way over time and\u2026\nGerry Seidman: So sorry.\nTom Sweeney: yeah, no problem. but thank you Gerry's, very interesting. And if we'd love to have you back in the future,\nGerry Seidman: Okay, I'm gonna post that I post. Only I possibly, you guys have. Yeah. Hopefully that wasn't too fast.\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, we have the link.\nTom Sweeney: That briefly.\nMatt Heon: That's delay until Monday. Four minutes is a little late to talk about this and I don't want pushes. or without we'll delay this,\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Okay.\nMatt Heon: until next time we can\nTom Sweeney: Okay, yeah, it's gonna be a couple.\nDaniel Walsh: I get.\nTom Sweeney: Yeah. This.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, just for those I guess we're not gonna start for another week for that sex is what bottom line, right?\nMatt Heon: Yeah, at this point I would like to get things rolling but we can probably get the ball rolling during the planning on Tuesday and then see things roll from there. I would hope to have an RC out in two weeks maximum.\n00:55:00\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, and our end goal for four sixes to have something out by mid to late August.\nMatt Heon: No, that's four seven and go for four,\u2026\nMatt Heon: six is to have something out very early July. Hopefully\nTom Sweeney: But much more expedient that I had Given that I think I'm going to wrap up this meeting and just I do.\nGerry Seidman: I'm going to question\u2026\nTom Sweeney: No, I do the Sure.\nGerry Seidman: if I make is really advanced when we met you, we talked about there should be a man page other than storage on Conf Where would man information go? I can't think of any place because there's no just storage.com Good.\nDaniel Walsh: Right. You're going to Storage.com. Yeah.\nGerry Seidman: Okay, I just wanted to confirm that. Thank you.\nTom Sweeney: Okay, so our next cabal meeting will be on July 20th. Same time, 11 o'clock in the morning eastern time and then our next community meeting will be happening on Tuesday, August 1st. I'd like to thank Gerry very much for coming here. Presenting today is great information and for everybody participating and with that, I'm going to turn off the recording.\nTom Sweeney: And so many buttons to click to turn off the recording, Anybody want to say anything or comment anything? Without recording going on.\nTom Sweeney: Because a big fat no and say let's go get some lunch dinner and get out of here. Right.\nDaniel Walsh: Nope. Gerry I'm glad I could attend but I was supposed to be on a flight out to Europe and never made\u2026\nGerry Seidman: I'm glad you got made it\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: So, I'm stuck in DC right now. So,\nGerry Seidman: hopefully, it clarified a little bit more what we're doing.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, know I found an interesting. It's\nGerry Seidman: Yeah. This scary thing is how incredibly simple it is. and\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: yeah.\nGerry Seidman: it works because we have a million lines of code of a really good secure distribution policy system underneath but the ALS part and\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: Right.\nGerry Seidman: they container part it's trivial.\nDaniel Walsh: What was AFS first introduced,\nGerry Seidman: It isn't a history of the brief history. once upon a time, There were no computer science departments, there were math, departments at ED Departments, and back in 1982, CMU was forming a computer science department and IBM. And if you want to start a department, you need researchers to pull it in. So, I'd be able to length and seven of the researchers, when IBM did real research and gave them 35 million dollars and said, Focus on distributed computing. And that was the start of the CMU Department and the start of the Andrew project.\nGerry Seidman: And many things came out of the Andrew Project. IBM's distributed transaction processing system came out of that and they made a billion dollars on that. So they got their money back in spades and the end system came out of it, too. the intention was to spin off companies FS on into plans are IBM, which was a product. No idea in real life, AFS doesn't sell hardware and they decided sunset, it and ended up and open source. and it struggled in open source and forest formed by them primary open source, people to Make it good. And he mentioned,\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: It's cool.\nGerry Seidman: who's using it, by the Department of Defense is used by Horn of Energy. She's my major banks, many different use cases.\nTom Sweeney: The PCE back in the day. Also, Do you know was a part of DCE distributed computing environment.\nGerry Seidman: it was,\u2026\nTom Sweeney: That was a\nGerry Seidman: There was a fork of it. That went into that, I think. Again, that's way before my time. You\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: Thank you.\nGerry Seidman: I'm relatively new to this world. In historical.\nDaniel Walsh: Dte DC came a few years later. So,\nGerry Seidman: Yeah.\nTom Sweeney: There are some early 90s.\nDaniel Walsh: but,\nGerry Seidman: Yeah. What happened was got Guam density, Athena project. If you remember the Athena project MIT, which you did okay.\nDaniel Walsh: I worked on it being a project, so\nGerry Seidman: Which led to some licensing issues and it issues and questions that Dot, It was a different world. But how software was?\nGerry Seidman: Used by different people.\nTom Sweeney: Banner,\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nTom Sweeney: you're making it to check. Are you coming back to me?\nDaniel Walsh: I am making it to check and flying out at 5:30 tonight. And Mandela,\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Choices.\nDaniel Walsh: I'm right outside of Dulles airport right now. Waiting to Have any extended stay at a hotel room.\nDaniel Walsh: Late. Check out.\nTom Sweeney: Yikes.\nDaniel Walsh: alright. Good Gerry, good step, one done. I need step two, three four. And we'll\nGerry Seidman: Okay, I've written the documentation, but the problem is that, I think I wrote too much For the Man page but I'll run that by you.\n01:00:00\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, you're probably confused the all right.\nGerry Seidman: Excuse me.\nDaniel Walsh: You'll probably confuse everybody by putting a huge section. Yeah.\nGerry Seidman: The Man page for AIS is one line. Put stuff here.\nGerry Seidman: I could do that too.\nDaniel Walsh: Alright.\nGerry Seidman: Thank you guys. Have a great afternoon.\n")))}gi.isMDXComponent=!0;const yi={},wi="Podman Community Cabal Meeting Notes",fi=[{value:"July 20, 2023 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-5)",id:"july-20-2023-1100-am-eastern-utc-5",level:2},{value:"Attendees:",id:"attendees",level:2},{value:"July 20, 2023 Topics",id:"july-20-2023-topics",level:2},{value:"Meeting Notes",id:"meeting-notes",level:3},{value:"Passwd and group entry handling with <code>--user</code>, etc. issue (0:354 in the video) - Justin Jereza",id:"passwd-and-group-entry-handling-with---user-etc-issue-0354-in-the-video---justin-jereza",level:3},{value:"ipfs integration into Podman - Anders Bjorklund",id:"ipfs-integration-into-podman---anders-bjorklund",level:3},{value:"Podman Release (32:33 in the video) - Matt Heon",id:"podman-release-3233-in-the-video---matt-heon",level:3},{value:"Open discussion (: in the video)",id:"open-discussion--in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Next Meeting: Thursday, August 16, 2023, 11:00 a.m. EDT (UTC-5)",id:"next-meeting-thursday-august-16-2023-1100-am-edt-utc-5",level:3},{value:"Possible Topics",id:"possible-topics",level:2},{value:"Next Community Meeting: Tuesday, August 1, 2023, 11:00 a.m. EDT (UTC-5)",id:"next-community-meeting-tuesday-august-1-2023-1100-am-edt-utc-5",level:3},{value:"Possible Topics:",id:"possible-topics-1",level:3},{value:"Raw Meeting Chat:",id:"raw-meeting-chat",level:3},{value:"Raw Google Meet Transcript",id:"raw-google-meet-transcript",level:3}],ki={toc:fi},bi="wrapper";function vi(e){let{components:t,...n}=e;return(0,Ne.kt)(bi,(0,ce.Z)({},ki,n,{components:t,mdxType:"MDXLayout"}),(0,Ne.kt)("h1",{id:"podman-community-cabal-meeting-notes"},"Podman Community Cabal Meeting Notes"),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"july-20-2023-1100-am-eastern-utc-5"},"July 20, 2023 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-5)"),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"attendees"},"Attendees:"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Aditya Rajan, Anders F Bj\xf6rklund, Ashley Cui, Ed Santiago Munoz, Jake Correnti, Justin Jereza, Lokesh Mandvekar, Martin Jackson, Matt Heon, Miloslav Trmac, Mohan Boddu, Nalin Dahyabhai, Paul Holzinger, Tom Sweeney, Valentin Rothberg"),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"july-20-2023-topics"},"July 20, 2023 Topics"),(0,Ne.kt)("ol",null,(0,Ne.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"passwd and group entry handling with ",(0,Ne.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"--user"),", etc. ",(0,Ne.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18903"},"issue")," - Justin Jereza"),(0,Ne.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"ipfs integration into Podman - Anders Bj\xf6rklund to kick off",(0,Ne.kt)("ul",{parentName:"li"},(0,Ne.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"See ",(0,Ne.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl/blob/main/docs/ipfs.md"},"https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl/blob/main/docs/ipfs.md"),"\nit is about peer-to-peer image distribution, using OCI ",(0,Ne.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://github.com/containerd/stargz-snapshotter/blob/main/docs/INSTALL.md#install-stargz-store-for-cri-opodman-with-systemd"},"estargz")," format"),(0,Ne.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"Question for containers/image, fallback is ",(0,Ne.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"localhost:5050/ipfs/<CID>"),"\n(proxy server from IPFS, started with ",(0,Ne.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"nerdctl ipfs registry serve"),")")))),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"meeting-notes"},"Meeting Notes"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Video ",(0,Ne.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://youtu.be/O-6RWIcIvqk"},"Recording")),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Meeting start 11:05 a.m. Thursday, July 20, 2023"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"passwd-and-group-entry-handling-with---user-etc-issue-0354-in-the-video---justin-jereza"},"Passwd and group entry handling with ",(0,Ne.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"h3"},"--user"),", etc. ",(0,Ne.kt)("a",{parentName:"h3",href:"https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/18903"},"issue")," (0:354 in the video) - Justin Jereza"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Docker wasn't able to create the uid/gid correctly, but Podman was.

The first one is about password and group country handling with desktop user and etc. That on Justin's gonna be leaving us on. We also had a discussion about Ipfs integration department lined up over, Dan and Brent are both not here and Anders, who would kind of kicking that off for us, was kind of saying that. Maybe we ought to wait off for that. Once I think we're not going to discuss that much. We have Somebody with strong opinions to do so today. And then Matt you wanted to talk a little bit about pot Versions coming out to\nMatt Heon: Sure I can give us another video that's\nTom Sweeney: Okay, go and talk about that after Justin finishes. So with all that, just welcome to the meetings. Nice to have you here. And please leave it off.\nJustin Jereza: just, Going forward.\nJustin Jereza: Okay, so I said, put my plug in the issue that she could make up to the hospital and said. It's scary. And\nValentin Rothberg: No.\nTom Sweeney: Yes, it looks good.\nJustin Jereza: Happens. Is that\nJustin Jereza: but,\nJustin Jereza: Okay, so what happens?\nJustin Jereza: create password and the bottoman base. So that's\nJustin Jereza: so he followed by the office, why\nJustin Jereza: The problems. Where he?\nJustin Jereza: So, you can see here.\nJustin Jereza: That's the problem. so,\nJustin Jereza: so this thing that we'll find it. And it's a series of Department of events that you.\nJustin Jereza: That's the senior, and File. And finally,\nJustin Jereza: So that's even presentation. There. Yes.\nJustin Jereza: And I think Chris also got the supposed and that this Are almost.\nJustin Jereza: presentation. and finally,\n00:05:00\nJustin Jereza: that's US Open. before, like, He?\nJustin Jereza: post and with just\nJustin Jereza: And that's what he\nJustin Jereza: so we know for acceptable commandments.\nJustin Jereza: In this case, 25 with the possibility of adding something either. Which were I don't do the same thing. This user host was just take the bathroom people that are so moving experiment. I think we can actually useful person in certainly. And just did and just innovation somewhere that you can do the classroom and password you.\nJustin Jereza: And that would eliminate those three. And so far, I hope the industry much\nJustin Jereza: So that's the community. What? It boils down to we have These six options and how do we move forward from there? And the presentation give him what's mentioned in the issue and what\nJustin Jereza: the status.\nJustin Jereza: So I don't I think that's it. You guys have any comments on this?\nTom Sweeney: I have a hard time following a little bit as well just know, because the audio was kind of Creaky or monthly I guess. I don't know. Any Valentin or Matt. Do you have any thoughts based on this or the discussion that's been going on? And issues.\nValentin Rothberg: no, I did not follow the issue, so I guess it will be hard To, I guess find consensus now in the meeting. on how to move forward, but thanks a lot for the problem. how would you prefer to move forward? Justin?\nTom Sweeney: Ation.\nJustin Jereza: He mentioned in.\nTom Sweeney: Ation.\nTom Sweeney: Ation.\nJustin Jereza: Okay.\n00:10:00\nJustin Jereza: There are.\nJustin Jereza: Of what he? About where as the corresponding. Password entries into the container energy that Doctor doesn't have.\nJustin Jereza: The second part.\nJustin Jereza: You Want to show you often a different example.\nJustin Jereza: What he\nJustin Jereza: and create a course on YouTube option, that would be the same for groups. Even. We place the objects or remove the entirely and need able to presentation. that you\nJustin Jereza: I said,\nJustin Jereza: The time.\nMatt Heon: Comments after everything.\nJustin Jereza: sorry, I\nTom Sweeney: I've just added it.\nJustin Jereza: saw the Side. And\nTom Sweeney: It's in the.\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, it is in the agenda, not just added it into the Google meet chat as well\u2026\nJustin Jereza: yeah.\nTom Sweeney: if that's easier.\nMatt Heon: I will say that there's going to be resistance to the idea of moving any functionality away from existing, I can use this. That is The reason we added a lot of this was for convenience and we recognize that it's not necessarily completely compatible Maybe it's not been cases The ability to just do and use your smile user and gets a fairly musical session is important. So I think that we don't necessarily want to take\nJustin Jereza: so, I'm thinking basically how about just organizations down here. So,\nJustin Jereza: okay, reduce to lose you.\nJustin Jereza: and Then for user Presentation says, but he\nJustin Jereza: And that's\nJustin Jereza: then finally, He?\nMatt Heon: I don't know if we want to stream sleep system behavior. You can definitely additional offense that are going to guarantee creation of guarantee modification. The password, I'm not at all close to that, thought it always that. If we were to modify the behavior of existing usually group options, we are going to break people. It is hardly\n00:15:00\nJustin Jereza: The user options. Anything like you just and us and that's what.\nJustin Jereza: lead to, I just\nJustin Jereza: Completely others are how? And yeah.\nJustin Jereza: You thought so then?\nPaul Holzinger: So, maybe the question is What does the problem with? Adding the Entry, it is then actual problem, like something preventing you from getting us to work. Or it's just a different in, if you look at the fire because I don't, See. Why your container image would care that much,\nJustin Jereza: yes, I don't think. That he needs it from how God, it deserves as an impact. Okay. Yes if\nJustin Jereza: I don't really see any. So, If you guys inside that, Hector, and it's okay. But I think that, okay.\nPaul Holzinger: Yeah, because if we would remove adding the entry, then stuff could change behavior, right? If you ask what's your username in the container? If there's no entry Then You cannot know. So, for Portman uses that, it's a potential recreation and we try to avoid making this change. And if there's no reason for this change, just other than toca compat, but there is no one who breaks. I don't see why Be sure to change it at all,\nJustin Jereza: It's yes, a difference in behavior, not that I really believe that. it's 25 anything wrong with And differently. The problem that's handled.\nMatt Heon: If I remember correctly, this was originally added as convenience functionality, or ruthless pot man. I don't remember the exact context of that that there is a reason why we put it in the first place. if I had an opinion here would be that it's That it's not consistent because I'm 90 I don't have the code in front of me, but I kind of remember what it looks like. And I'm pretty sure the 90% of circumstances were not going to change password and group, but in the 10% circumstances that we do, it could be confusing. So we definitely have a documentation problem It's not going to be clear to users. Why these changes? Have. But what do you call it? I don't necessarily know.\n00:20:00\nPaul Holzinger: Seen the big use case, I think is the user anders keep which sets your user ID and then in the container you want, the classic Toolbox use case basically so, You want your user copied in and\u2026\nJustin Jereza: He?\nPaul Holzinger: and behave it, The same. I think it was probably edit because of something like that.\nJustin Jereza: I think that basically just thoughts, and in the editor that I can see, And I think that's the three box situation where you would want it. That's inviting so, I did where it's a reason. Why this in You should increase. so,\nJustin Jereza: I think that's a good.\nJustin Jereza: Within the big nation. Yeah.\nJustin Jereza: The next thing happened. we're getting the functionality of the group. the other thing is,\nJustin Jereza: I like this. Okay.\nJustin Jereza: The name of the user. And so it's the line that shows you. And in this case instead of coffee, which I believe in this case, yes, that's the name of the house. He?\nJustin Jereza: Said.\nJustin Jereza: I did, he just\nJustin Jereza: I mean problems and\nJustin Jereza: Keep. I just\nMiloslav Trmac: Okay, I think using group ID in the Group Name. Field is just not going to work. So if we are doing that, I don't know whether it's about that we can always fix. I'm not familiar with the code but there's definitely something\nJustin Jereza: So let's\n00:25:00\nJustin Jereza: Know.\nMiloslav Trmac: Bottle bubbly. I mean we kind of invent an entirely new random name. Just the principle of the thing is that there has to be a name India.\nMiloslav Trmac: Or. Maybe actually not. I'm sorry\u2026\nJustin Jereza: So I guess one way to think about this,\u2026\nMiloslav Trmac: if you are Edina and entry.\nJustin Jereza: this will you mind space on whether they're actually?\nJustin Jereza: So in the case of, I think that options they should follow you in this case, The. Saves me. But he accepts and happening on both. when it comes into the containment and not presentation,\nJustin Jereza: and then,\nJustin Jereza: that's,\nJustin Jereza: But if we did have that, then both of these will also look at the host.\nJustin Jereza: Coffee here. It's probably really the last two. Which should allow me to. I\nJustin Jereza: And so password, and something that has books\nJustin Jereza: You and the same, it's good for you to hold and Just talking.\nJustin Jereza: the wheels are the people who really\nJustin Jereza: Wow, happy and the post.\nJustin Jereza: Silently as well.\nJustin Jereza: But I think if\nJustin Jereza: and the issue I\nJustin Jereza: Specifically. And whether they should be probably from the host or not,\nJustin Jereza: It's here.\nTom Sweeney: So I'm hearing a bit of silence here and I think people need some time to digest and take a look at the issue on Github and we probably ought to wrap this up in a few more minutes just in. Is there anything else you'd like to ask her say\n00:30:00\nJustin Jereza: It just something that has to solved immediately, it's just\nJustin Jereza: it's right education.\nJustin Jereza: and there are matrix. so,\nMatt Heon: I'm going to tag Dan Walsh on this issue. That is like, he's not in the meeting right now, but I think it was the original instigator behind Ad.\nJustin Jereza: Yeah. So if you have any more and protectively, we're done.\nJustin Jereza: if you guys think I've been right, yeah.\nJustin Jereza: that's,\nTom Sweeney: Sorry, I'm talking away on mute which isn't very helpful at all. Justin, thank you so much for coming today and getting this discussion going and I'm sure it will continue on inside Github and I RC and Matrix going forward. Matt's, you have plot, Coming up pretty soon. You want talked about that a little bit.\nMatt Heon: Let's see. So we are getting ready for for six. We are in Rc2 right now and Ashley correct me if I'm wrong but I expect a final release and\u2026\nJustin Jereza: E.\nMatt Heon: sometime early next week. Is that what we were planning or am I wrong?\nAshley Cui: I thought we were putting the release today.\nMatt Heon: Okay, that's early that I was expecting but that gives everyone something to look forward to after this so pod, 4 6, final probably. Today, we are still expecting to do a four seven. We were expected to do with this summer, but honestly, at this point, it's probably gonna slip into September, but I would expect a four seven in early fall, I would call it and then a four eight somewhere in the February ish timeframe. four six it's a moderately large release, it's a fairly substantial feature release. It's been a while since I looked at the, What do you call the voice notes? But it's gonna have some interesting things. I think this is not\nMatt Heon: Is this one of the bigger releases for what? I call it Admin Machine? I'm thinking we added something big there at the point is slipping my mind.\nAshley Cui: Not a big feature, but a big fix. I think for stabilization.\nMatt Heon: That's worse. Yeah, we have a lot of bug fixes in system service. We have a spattering of each releases everywhere and generally speaking, I am expecting a 461 and a week or so that'll have a bunch of public fixes it based on any issues, the release happens. And then of course seven maybe six weeks thereafter and four seven is going to include a couple other interesting features. I'm hopeful that we can get some additional windows support in the pot and machine, especially man on hyper-b. We're putting a lot of work in there and I don't want to speak for Brett because he's not here. Maybe we will also have some things. osx native virtualization. let's see. and that's probably the odd, man, composed work that Valentin has been working on the other that just landed. So, feel free to look at that comments.\n00:35:00\nMatt Heon: Yeah, that's about it Wise any questions?\nTom Sweeney: I'm hearing silence.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: When would this come to the apartment machine or core OS?\nMatt Heon: Usually, we expect that poor to six week. Basically, we have to get into fedora. Then we have to work our way through the fedora core os, unstable, streams until it's in stable. So, we usually expect to lag by about a month six weeks. It could easily be faster on that, but it usually takes this year or a couple weeks beyond that, so you get at Paul's compose. Exactly. So there is a substantial time.\nTom Sweeney: Must not this particular Pac-Man release but any partner released in general, right?\nMatt Heon: Yeah. If it is a particularly important noise, if we had some absolutely critical bug fixed in, there are ways we can expedite, but we prefer not to do that because it puts more workload on us, it with your work, run the F cost team. And generally speaking, no one likes doing this. So, if we do not have something extremely urgent, we're going to go through the soap process which\nTom Sweeney: It sounds good. Right, I'm not sure if I mentioned this after I started the recording but we're going to pass on the ipfs integration into Pod man topic that we had on the agenda today we're going to push that out later or perhaps even postpone it further discussions to go offline on that and then given that I am going to open up to any topics or questions at this point in the open discussion session. If I have anything they want to talk about or ask questions about\nTom Sweeney: It's two centigrate equipment. you're considering I'll just note when our next For the Cabal again will be Thursday. August 16th 2023 at 11am in our community meeting is coming up very soon. It's actually just a little under two weeks now, I guess. And that's going to be on Tuesday, August 1st. Also at 11:00 am. I would love to have topics for other? I have one topic for the community meeting at what it is right now but I don't have any flickable at this point. So if you have suggestions for topics that you'd like to see or presentation better yet present on Friday, those meetings, I'd love to hear one last call. Any further questions, comments. Why is I'll stop the recording?\nJustin Jereza: And sorry guys.

People can also change the text after it was created.\n\nTom Sweeney: Good morning This is Thursday, September 21st, 2023 already just a few days away from fall. This is the Podman Community, Cabal meeting. We have just one discussion point today. So I hope people brought good questions for. So we can fill up some of the time that I'm sure we'll have. And with that said, I'm just going to turn it over to our one topic and Matt had decided to eat that and I'm sure Brent can also jump in. Also And let's talk about default settings for appointment 4.7 which just came up Matt.\n\nMatt Heon: Okay, so we have podman 4.7 rc1 out. Now we're looking for in RC\n\nMatt Heon: We might do an rc2 this week, I'll put it that way. And then we are definitely doing a 47 final next week just to get schedule out the way. And we're at a very late point in this release but it's still not too late for us to discuss certain configuration changes that we'd like to make because we'd like them to soak in Victor or for a while before we put them in Frankly but also because we'd like to get these out as soon as possible. So actually start using them. the more important ones here is switching default database. We had the SQLite driver added in odd, man for six, but we haven't made it default yet. We've been letting it sit and I think at this point, we're pretty happy with how stable it is. We've been running it through I extensively. We haven't had issues. So we would like to swap the default database from both DB to seek light for new installations only in 4.7\n\nMatt Heon: Going to be supporting the BOLD database and if you have a existing volt database you'll keep using it. But SQLite will be the default for new installs and four seven or at least we'd like it to be.\n\nMatt Heon: And I believe there were some other things called out in the default features.\n\nTom Sweeney: Before we go there, Brent had a question in the chat, Matt.\n\nMatt Heon: Sure, it is not the default in the main branch bread. So we would have to get this developed in over the next week. But at this point, this is an hours worth of code. So this is not a difficult thing to get.\n\nBrent Baude: I'm the only reason I asked is it would seem? I mean I want to make the change to so I'm supportive of whatever decision, the team makes, but it was seen reasonable That. For one development cycle, it would be the default in the main branch.\n\nBrent Baude: while we work on for eight or whatever ends up to be, Just so that. We have a little bit of silk time on our own hands.\n\nTom Sweeney: No, would it be possible to do that before our C2?\n\nMatt Heon: We were not initially planning on an rc2. If I worked on it this afternoon I think there's a decent chance we could get it all done. But it would be cutting it very close. Paul and Valentin. You and your answer.\n\nPaul Holzinger: And in my opinion doing this no is not in the purpose of doing an rc1 and it's not expectation and we say we are feature of frozen and we decide to change a critical default which the database is critical. So I,\n\nMatt Heon: Honestly, I don't know when this agenda item was added. I feel like it was intended to be discussed a lot sooner. So I think you're right about that. A lot of these are going to end up being 4.8. Regardless, we are too late in the cycles. Do major things. I don't necessarily view the sequel database as a major thing, just because how much we've tested it. But I agree with you that we are very late.\n\nBrent Baude: Can we not just we branched, right? So do the work and\u2026\n\nMatt Heon: Yeah, we're branch. We can easily throw all this stuff in main right now.\n\nBrent Baude: flick it now and make it a 4-8 target. That would mean, I'm kind of agreeing with Paul here in the sense that Maybelline features is sort of naughty on a release candidates. So, what's the downside of waiting other than it doesn't get out there?\n\nMatt Heon: I think that is the big downside. It's first release will be,\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: Okay.\n\nMatt Heon: it'll go out everywhere. Basically it'll go out to send stream rel etc.\n\nBrent Baude: But it would seem reasonable to me that if we want to soak it at the door, we should have soaked it in Maine. At least that's my Justin. I'll check out after that.\n\nMatt Heon: I'm not going to push too hard for making changes this late in the game. I mean, it's small enough that I would say it's doable but that doable and sensible are different things.\n\n00:05:00\n\nMatt Heon: Given that are we? Okay with saying, No big changes for seven? Let's just change this agenda item to say four, eight, because four eight is looking like our next big release.\n\nTom Sweeney: I have slight concerns of doing that, kind of change for real without it soaking Infidor first. Then we target a 48. Yeah, in between Here in Rome in February.\n\nMatt Heon: Let's see. We're gonna have four eight or four seven out late, September. If we want to do a 4/8 or late November early December, We could do that. It wasn't on the plan, but As long as it's just an upstream release. It doesn't add that much burden. To what we're doing. Does everyone agree with that?\n\nBrent Baude: This is I guess the downside of the forced March schedule. That we've In the past,\u2026\n\nTom Sweeney: Yeah.\n\nBrent Baude: we've Released when we're ready.\n\nBrent Baude: At this point. I could make a strong argument because Hypervy just missed. For seven. I can make a strong argument that I would want to if I was Making decisions and releases were easy. I'd want to 48 in a month.\n\nBrent Baude: but, that's a quicker cadence than we've done as quick and so we've done in a while, but it makes sense. So, that maybe what we need to do is say, before we will Do sequel light. And we need to go back now and talk about a release schedule for eight.\n\nMatt Heon: Valentin.\n\nValentin Rothberg: I think we need to start doing notes because we had this conversation multiple times and in this year, What we said for fedora or discussed was to just make it a conf setting and default it there. So we don't necessarily need to do that in the main garage but one thing we didn't test yet is I don't think we tested it. Is. We need to make sure that even more existing deployments even if we default to make sure that the existing policy database continues to be used. This is something that have not been done yet to my knowledge so we are not ready. To just flip it now. There's still some work to be done. on this front. With respect to.\n\nValentin Rothberg: Merging things into RC and I would block every feature into our RC's. it has a number of times and we came up with the document to never Merge features during RC base, and I think we should continue to stick to it. Otherwise, we just keep on Budding us in the mail. There's a specialty for things that haven't been properly tested or bigger things. They will always introduce regressions. And that is what makes the release process and in the past to make it hard. just a reminder on this front.\n\nTom Sweeney: So Europe, are you okay with doing the changes in a 4-8 for this going?\n\nValentin Rothberg: And sure as long as we're ready and as long as upgrade scenarios work. So what needs to work is that unless being specified in containers, where a user explicitly says I want to use SQLite or explicitly things set on the CLI, if the internal default from memory SQLite, there's an existing wall TP database we need to use this multi beat database, otherwise, On update users will not see any of their objects, containers, volumes networks, etc anymore.\n\nMatt Heon: contested, in my view, I\n\nValentin Rothberg: Our absolutely but it's an item that hasn't been done for many months now and it's something we need to do before, flipping the default and before refreshing it. It'm not saying it's hard, I'm just saying it needs to be done.\n\n00:10:00\n\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, where does 47 live? It's still up in Maine. Is the branch. Okay.\n\nMatt Heon: That's branched already. We branched before RCS.\n\nTom Sweeney: So we could make the changes of main at any point in time.\n\nMatt Heon: at this point after thinking about 4/8, the sooner the better otherwise we will forget about\n\nTom Sweeney: Yeah. That's my thinking as well.\n\nMatt Heon: Are I think we've come to a general decision here? That we're going to do The only question is how we're going to do for it, whether it's going to be in earlier release. We have a guaranteed release coming out in February, are going to do it release for that and have February before nine. So I think we can move on the assumption that the release schedule will be decided. Later is everyone comfortable?\n\nMatt Heon: All right, the next default we wanted to talk about was Z standard chunked. Plus Gzip split compression. We do not have any in the room. Discuss Anyone else here? Sufficiently comfortable with Formatting to talk about this because frankly, I'm not as up to speed on this as I should be.\n\nTom Sweeney: Giuseppe would be our other person, perhaps.\n\nValentin Rothberg: Yeah would also point to Giuseppe which Giuseppe you mentioned at least chunked isn't yet? Ready for prime time, right?\n\nGiuseppe Scrivano: Yeah, it's not really. There is still an open issue in continuous image, that needs to be merged. So I think we should postpone it for now.\n\nPaul Holzinger: I think what then was throwing around was always like that. You push this multi manifest thing with Statistity and Jesus. By default, I think that was what then wanted so that, new clients can benefit from the faster. So that's really pulls.\n\nGiuseppe Scrivano: Yeah, but still then first of all the feature it needs to be manually enabled and second it's not ready without The changes that the containers image, it's kind of broken.\n\nGiuseppe Scrivano: So, I mean it's fine for our performance, but Without that changes, it's not really usable, right?\n\nTom Sweeney: This is something that you think will be ready by a late November or February timeframe Giuseppe or beyond that.\n\nGiuseppe Scrivano: I'm working on that. I mean, I hope this will be done in the next. Few weeks.\n\nTom Sweeney: Okay.\n\nValentin Rothberg: I think this is something very critical. because,\n\nValentin Rothberg: Whatman is being used. So if the goal is to compress images by default with C standards with C standard compression, this can break a lot of deployments.\n\nValentin Rothberg: So I think in my opinion this is something important. Because imagine\u2026\n\nTom Sweeney: August.\n\nValentin Rothberg: if you have a build plan, you use the apartment, let's say department knowledge or you updated or on your server people pipeline, you build the image, you push it. And suddenly Your clients or your deployments outside in a while. Start to break because they do not support these standard yet, maybe all the versions of docker, maybe very, very old versions of Scorpio appointment or build up this. This can break.\n\nPaul Holzinger: but the ideas to push both compression formats now 12 a period where you push set the city in Jesus which of course is Ben Roeth more expensive and time but I think that was what then was always suggesting\n\nValentin Rothberg: This could in theory break as well, if the deployments expect a single image manifest and not an OCI index on the registry. So, I guess we're pointing at this.\n\nValentin Rothberg: Before deciding this default. I think we need to do some I don't find a better word. Sorry risk management of which things may put everything on the desk and then look at all potential risks and then check whether you're comfortable doing. But this changes. One, or how images look like in the nature of images? And this is something we're\n\n00:15:00\n\nValentin Rothberg: feeling uncomfortable.\n\nTom Sweeney: I think it's valid concerns, but are you comfortable with delivering automaton 5.0? in real next year, just worth waiting, not long for the zsd chunk, and we can push back, if it's not in before then.\n\nValentin Rothberg: I would even challenge whether it's reasonable for apartment image, push to push a manifest, if there is a portman manifest push. So I think we're at the risk of conflating or breaking things. So, I would even question whether we should do it or not. So, I can't really answer that. That's all.\n\nTom Sweeney: Okay, that's fair.\n\nMatt Heon: What I am hearing here is that we are extremely uncomfortable with this going into Rel first. So, this absolutely. I mean, even if we do a four, eight four hand, it sounds like it's probably not going to be ready. This does sound like It's a lot of additional testing. So this is if we're doing something between the February release and the next little release that this is potentially good time frame for that sound I mean, assuming that we can make it work.\n\nValentin Rothberg: I think we should follow up on this soon. So that we make sure that, The thinking continues about the issues or about this particular issues, how do we want it to behave? What are we trying to achieve in? What are we at risk of breaking?\n\nValentin Rothberg: At the moment it's just me throwing my foot in the door\u2026\n\nMatt Heon: Okay.\n\nValentin Rothberg: but I would be curious. I don't see. Minnows left in the meeting but nalin has to build specialist. what are you feeling about this?\n\nNalin Dahyabhai: Again.\n\nValentin Rothberg: How do you feel about the idea of just pushing these multicompressed image manifests that are a single image on apartment push?\n\nNalin Dahyabhai: No. I don't think I have any thoughts that haven't already been waste about additional bandwidth and I mean I'm not really worried about compatibility with registries at this point.\n\nNalin Dahyabhai: the bandwidth is the compute for compression because when you're building a cluster it's Compression actually is one of the more expensive parts.\n\nChristopher Evich: This should work with the new.\n\nNalin Dahyabhai: but,\n\nChristopher Evich: I mean zooming gets into pod It should work with the new Farm builds, right?\n\nChristopher Evich: Listen Theory.\n\nNalin Dahyabhai: I thought we did this push time, so we didn't actually modify the images when they were on disc because they're not compressed on disk when you build them.\n\nValentin Rothberg: Form build is something awful about this Creating Multi-arch Manifest Lists easier. But it doesn't address. The issue of compression, algorithms. US trying to push for C standard as the new standard.\n\nMatt Heon: I definitely. Are we comfortable leaving this here? And doing a follow-up later with more? I think we're really suffering. We're missing. less. Love and Audi, and Dan. Would be okay with having a meeting later. We'll have more people who actually know a lot about this in the\n\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, I think that's a good idea.\n\nMatt Heon: All right, in that case, I propose that we move on to the next one, which is setting default network command to pasta by default.\n\nMatt Heon: Paul. This one is mostly Feelings on it. Are we stable enough to do this?\n\nPaul Holzinger: No. I mean, it depends. The biggest problem is that the outstanding work that we need to deliver the ruthlessness logic if you use named networks, And that's still hard coded to Slurp. So as long as that isn't the rest that I don't see a pointed defaulting to Pastor for the normal problem. Because then, that means that every distribution. Definitely needs to require both SD product for example. it's\n\n00:20:00\n\nPaul Holzinger: yeah, I don't particularly you see the benefits of switching it before. The networking stuff works really.\n\nMatt Heon: Okay, and this is mostly the pasta. Maintainers not us.\n\nPaul Holzinger: Know that would be me and also a bit on pasta but The thing how it works is that we have these intermediate namespace and inside of namespace, we just use But never work with pitch networking, but to connect this intermediate namespace, with those namespace, you need and the ruthless networking tool. So, I love or pasta and since this was written, two and a half years ago, that it just uses slow. And now I need to convert this code and that's not particularly\n\nPaul Holzinger: evie, I would say that there are Their corner case of everywhere, basically. And then assumptions And, when I touched the code, I try to make it better. So A bit of a longer process. To get this done.\n\nPaul Holzinger: Thought of I always have it in my queue, but it's always something comes on top of it usually. So, I didn't progress in the last week.\n\nBrent Baude: Why are we coughing with my name?\n\nTom Sweeney: How much time?\n\nMatt Heon: Really, it sounds like this switching to pasta by default is enough work that we're going to need. It's not going to get done unless it's prioritize is what I'm hearing from Paul. Does that sound Acc?\n\nPaul Holzinger: It would make it much faster. If we say that the priority, but,\n\nBrent Baude: But you guys get the prioritize as much as I do.\n\nTom Sweeney: sometimes you think Paul,\u2026\n\nMatt Heon: All right.\n\nTom Sweeney: if you were just single way devoted to wrap it up, You talking?\n\nPaul Holzinger: the problem is coding, not like I know what needs to be done and writing a code. That's maybe a week of work. But then making sure that all comes together. and Everything works. one outstanding problem. Why? I haven't devoted more time on it. If port forwarding problem. So right now, what really happens. Is that with forwarding? We use the routers port process. So that's a process that respond to a container.\n\nPaul Holzinger: And the problem is that this process is it's a dumb. Proxy basically and it makes it source IP. So that's the biggest complaint with ruthless networking and the port forwarding, We have My Source IP and in your website a lot. That's Not very good for auditing stuff. but someone's compromised and you don't have to iPS and I don't have a good answer to the port forwarding problem with possibly can do port forwarding. But it's missing the option to do this dynamically. So as we As respawn. we would only have one part of the process in this rootless, networking scenario. and that means we need to Forwarding capabilities\n\nPaul Holzinger: And that's not impossible. I talk to the person maintenance day. we are on an agreement that can be done and They accept pensions, but it's like, somebody needs to prioritize and make the work and So it's kind of stuff.\n\nMatt Heon: Fair enough. Personally, I would love to see this in Fibo, so That gives us a fair bit of time, but it would be very nice to have fivo with the improved networking.\n\nPaul Holzinger: Yeah, definitely. And I mean, Right now, we have a lot of Users trying it out just a regular pasta with Putman, Run Dash network pasta. and there we are able to, Fix the many bugs already. So I think it's getting in it to a point where it's definitely stated enough to say we do this before. So,\n\n00:25:00\n\nMatt Heon: Anything else on this? I think we know what needs to be done. We know it is a lot of work and it's probably going to need to be bubbled up in priorities at some point. But anything else\n\nTom Sweeney: I don't know. I don't need a hard answer to this, but what are you thinking for? Five, vogue delivery timeframe. Are you thinking next summer?\n\nMatt Heon: Yeah. Sometime early summer issue.\n\nTom Sweeney: Okay.\n\nMatt Heon: think we were thinking about this was potentially the next release after the February drop. Although we have options here again if we've really feel like we need some soak before five. we can give it less time and have an intermediate.\n\nValentin Rothberg: I think if we really want to push 50 through and it should be for or before relative Because I guess in 9. I think we can't ship five.\n\nTom Sweeney: So you're thinking a 501 say early spring and then five one for real 10, possibly.\n\nValentin Rothberg: I don't know. But it would make what makes sense to have? some sort of time or five hour and fedora before throwing into\n\nTom Sweeney: Yeah.\n\nMatt Heon: And for reference here, a lot of the breaking changes. We're thinking about in five though, we're going to be machine stuff so not directly relevant to the rail schedule. This is mostly getting podman machine in a more sane position than it is right now.\n\nValentin Rothberg: A couple of comments in our code and upstream issues that would impact Rel as well.\n\nMatt Heon: Yeah, of course, we have a lot of accumulated, 50.\n\nPaul Holzinger: Yeah, I find that. More useful to make a list of what we want to do for five and maybe we're talking the speaker about containers comfort, for example. and I've find out how to set a deadline without seeing what we want to do first,\n\nMatt Heon: But I'm really hearing is that we probably need a 50 doc at some point like this or next week that we can just start accumulating. What needs to be done and from there, we can figure out exactly what's out and\u2026\n\nTom Sweeney: Yeah. This next one, but\n\nMatt Heon: what the schedule is.\n\nMatt Heon: I'll take responsibility for making that. I can do it after lunch. anyways, if we are okay with saying that 50 planning can wait, I think we have a couple things that are slam dunks before eight. Those being cni and deprecating on man Generate system D. Of Valentin. Did we already deprecate generate system D or was that just being discussed?\n\nValentin Rothberg: It is already deprecated, but not dropped. So, deprecation Since there are multiple interpretations of what In this case, we said deprecation to just encourage users. That will be a warning now being emitted and using it pointing users to qualit. known your features will be added only, important bug fixes will be edit, we could consider dropping it entirely with Botman 5 adult, but it's used generate system. D is used in many pipelines.\n\nValentin Rothberg: And personally, I don't think it hurts to keep it around if we can spare some Edmonds, some very hard time for sure. I would love people to jump on quadland but the duplication will at least or hopefully be sufficiently annoying at some point that people will jump to it and we also didn't, because Internet System has been out for a long long while. So even experienced popmen users,\n\nMatt Heon: So I think that deprecate what you said emitting warnings and putting in the man pages that it's going to be dropped, at some point is sufficient. at this point, the only question is whether we do that to CNI as well and now that we have the plugin system and net of arc, I think the answer is yes.\n\n00:30:00\n\nTom Sweeney: For 5.0.\n\nMatt Heon: I for eight. Potentially drop an entirely in 50.\n\nTom Sweeney: Yeah.\n\nMatt Heon: Brent's.\n\nTom Sweeney: Doesn't mean to Matt.\n\nBrent Baude: No. Both of you to No, I don't think we should drop. Until? The net filter stuff is done. Or was it Nettables or whatever? It is the one that we haven't done needs to be done?\n\nMatt Heon: We are no worse than them in that respect. They do not have.\n\nBrent Baude: At the same matter.\n\nMatt Heon: I'm thinking about this in terms of, Can we get it out before Rel 10?\n\nBrent Baude: All what's the real question?\n\nPaul Holzinger: Yesterday.\n\nMatt Heon: I think.\n\nBrent Baude: What are you really asking to do?\n\nMatt Heon: one prop, C, and put a deprecated notice in Maine right now, do it today,\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: Yes, that's fine.\n\nMatt Heon: Two. Figure out what the first release going into rallies and drop CNI before that, or at least conditional compile. and don't compile it into 10. Because if we put it in 10, we are guarantee. We have to support that for the next 10 years.\n\nBrent Baude: No, there's no doubt about that. So 50 to me would be the drop time. I had to excuse me myself but I was able to hear the conversation. I had an interruption here.\n\nBrent Baude: So that's fine On the podman 5 other thing. I'm gonna start a document here shortly. The problem that I'm having is that we have yet undefined requirements from the desktop team, On what this needs to be done, on And as far as five timing, In the most ideal world. Five, all gone out in early spring.\n\nBrent Baude: Five one will be. Something. That's real or 505. Pending on. How we do coming out the door, but something like the second release. Coming just before. Red Hat Summit. So, If I had mine, most ideal schedule, that would be it. And there should Not spend a lot of time thinking about why I would want it that way. The desktop team is going to do some splashes probably there. and it may very likely require some Change in our behalf to be able to support them to do that.\n\nBrent Baude: But that's all undefined right now, so that makes it a little fuzzy. But we should start final adopt that starts, talking about things. We're going to We already know that that's unrelated to machine. And anything else? Also, talked about containers Comp. Evolution. So there's plenty of things we could, put in there right now and start talking about. It probably warrants. A series of short conversations about things and then we can dont in a document. the folks are okay with that, and I'm happy to leave that effort.\n\nTom Sweeney: It matters talked about doing similar thing, but sounds like it's a combination.\n\nBrent Baude: Yeah, I heard that I probably should own it since the decisions are probably in the end to Mark and I'm on some of the stuff,\u2026\n\nTom Sweeney: Yep.\n\nBrent Baude: yeah. That. But otherwise, I think everything else is online. Matt, I mean, we're right on top of it. And at this point, late in the 48 game. Let's get the deprecation notices on things and we'll contemplate the actual drop or compile out. Type approach. For five.\n\nPaul Holzinger: What are you talking about? When you talk about deprecation, notice In the code.\n\nBrent Baude: I think we needed to display some sort of cnis going away.\n\nPaul Holzinger: Yeah, and that's where I'm like. That means a warning on every command, if Everywhere really touches the United.\n\nBrent Baude: we can do a suppress thing too to and we know\n\nMatt Heon: Just network create maybe. I mean.\n\nBrent Baude: Yeah.\n\nMatt Heon: Ultimately I would definitely want to see in the man pages and I want to see it on any Korean that creates a new network that is using the old tech.\n\n00:35:00\n\nBrent Baude: That's fair. And then we can get the usual docs and social.\n\nBrent Baude: Social media stuff out there, getting that idea ever out and I wonder too does RPM even maybe have a deprecation approach? when it gets installed to say, Hey, this is Not a thing. Anyways.\n\nLokesh Mandvekar: We can admit warnings maybe when something is installed or updated.\n\nBrent Baude: Paul. I don't know exactly what it means, but it's something along those lines. We don't want to spam people which I think is your concern.\n\nPaul Holzinger: Yeah. Yeah, it's just like putting it in dots is totally fine, but it will miss a lot of people just running in some deployment. So That makes.\n\nBrent Baude: Understood.\n\nPaul Holzinger: It's difficult line to navigate too much spam and not reaching the users. So\n\nBrent Baude: Indeed.\n\nMatt Heon: Going to be gone is critical.\n\nBrent Baude: we can also,\u2026\n\nPaul Holzinger: Will be.\n\nBrent Baude: Probably could do,\u2026\n\nPaul Holzinger: We needed.\n\nBrent Baude: we could do the message on everyone and in the message touch a file here to suppress this warning, so give them an out. There's lots of options.\n\nTom Sweeney: I wonder if.\n\nPaul Holzinger: do we need to change proposal for Fedora or something like that?\n\nBrent Baude: I don't believe so we may need to talk to F cost. But as far as I'm concerned, This doesn't affect them toolbox at me, impact.\n\nPaul Holzinger: No, it doesn't affect two books. They use,\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: Okay.\n\nPaul Holzinger: they use host networking exclusively. So\n\nBrent Baude: Okay, that's even better.\n\nMatt Heon: Realistically speaking, I think that we're going to need a change request for Pod Man, 5, obviously, but I don't think we need to be more specific than that, I I think we can just do one broad. We're upgrading Department 5, It'll have the following changes.\n\nTom Sweeney: I just wanted to, if we should put in early Deprecation, notice into the eight, nine, nine three, docs before it goes out.\n\nMatt Heon: It's not going to be deprecated in eight. Nine CNI.\n\nTom Sweeney: Like Christopher Warn.\n\nMatt Heon: CNI is going to be the standard on eight for the lifetime. I wonder if we already did it in nine I almost feel like we were discussing that at some point but\n\nTom Sweeney: All right, let me run down nine.\n\nMatt Heon: That's another part of why we can actually get away with this. if we're looking at the last major code, drop into related, the next in the very near future. And once that's done, we can actually think about getting rid of a lot of stuff. We were keeping around for eight.\n\nBrent Baude: So, can we Podman into rust. But 50.\n\nMatt Heon: Sure, We're just gonna have to drop machine and compose and I don't know, we'll choose 50% of the code base where we write that that's what you\n\nBrent Baude: Okay, so I guess, I took the ball on the 50 stuff and We'll just do some Meetings to carve out some basic time and some meetings to get Everyone's thoughts for at least written down and then we can begin to evaluate document.\n\nTom Sweeney: Should we move on to the generate system D?\n\nMatt Heon: Sounds good to.\n\nTom Sweeney: Or did we kind of discuss that? Yeah. Yeah.\n\nMatt Heon: That's already.\n\nBrent Baude: in terms of deprecating, it\n\nMatt Heon: It's already deprecated. wonderful thing.\n\nBrent Baude: it's been marked.\n\nTom Sweeney: We just went out of order and I'm just looking at the order here of the agenda. So we're all set there.\n\nBrent Baude: In terms of moving on, I'd be happy to move on to the next thing to talk about.\n\nMatt Heon: The next thing is others, so I guess Does anyone else have anything? They would want deprecated for a potential removal or adjustment in 50. We're not even deprecated. Does anyone have anything they want changed in the future to prepare for?\n\nBrent Baude: I would like a containers comp V2. Do we have that? Written down.\n\nMatt Heon: I don't think it's captured. Yeah.\n\nBrent Baude: Okay.\n\nBrent Baude: I think that there's a submitted one thing for a machine is I'm probably not going to sell this team very hard, but I think that we need to probably make every JSON. Config that keeps track of the machines resources and where everything sits the same across all providers. It is not today.\n\n00:40:00\n\nMatt Heon: I think we really just need to write down major machine refactor and then figure out what stems off of that.\n\nBrent Baude: I think a lot of that will be done in the four versions so specifically, because this may be a breaking change is one of them.\n\nMatt Heon: Yeah yeah we're discussing for eight as well as 50 so I'm like four eight four nine whatever we do before five I think we have to do a lot of refactoring to get ready five.\n\nBrent Baude: Particular one.\n\nBrent Baude: yeah, and I'm also seriously contemplating a proposal that would Make transition from four to five in the machine world. Not a thing. In other words, it's breaking machine release. Over action by users, will have to be taken.\n\nBrent Baude: So that's something that we need to debate the ups and downs of that. But I have good reasons which I know really want to go into right now, but That's a thing. Go ahead Paul.\n\nPaul Holzinger: and just not explicitly related to machine but General, I think we shouldn't Change things just because we've all benefit, We have a chance to break something that's fine, but that doesn't mean we need to break everything, right? So it's\n\nBrent Baude: Correct.\n\nBrent Baude: And I'm probably trying to dig out a little more space than we need. So that we're not pulling ourselves into migration scenarios that may over tax us. For the simple. Recovery of cloud, man, machine remote padman machine, and your backup. And, running, you just don't have your content. So,\n\nPaul Holzinger: Yeah I mean I think that's a fine assumption for a lot of things but it would be good to know document such as solutions. And anyway if there's a lot of you that later and the machine that's just gone, And I think some users might not really understand the concept If you're a butt reports,\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: Yep.\n\nPaul Holzinger: if you ask the judge recreate the machine and oops.\n\nBrent Baude: And the other bit is, we may be able to do some pinky around. Just\n\nBrent Baude: without some ideas on how we can potentially get around us. I think a Matt there was some stuff which I can't remember around Spec Gen. That we also had contemplated that we're breaking, so it needs somebody that crawl through the spectrum and take a look.\n\nPaul Holzinger: So, the important part is to have a way to define defaults on the server side, with that, comes together with containers.com somehow. because we want defaults on the server side,\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: Yes.\n\nPaul Holzinger: for the most part,\n\nMatt Heon: I think the ideal way to do this would be to refactor. the defaults are set in a common way across local and remote the spectrum gets pretty populated in a sensible way and\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: Yep.\n\nMatt Heon: it's those defaults that get displayed via the command line but that's a lot of work.\n\nBrent Baude: I mean That's kind of what we did when we went from whatever prior to specina. I forget what it was called but To Spec Jen. As we did we did some of that rearranging twisting. So it seems like that. We have to do that again. To deal with remote.\n\nMatt Heon: That is not. Echoical.\n\nPaul Holzinger: And what I would really love. Is some research during around, And what's local? In the code, the separation of concern in these packages, It's a mess. and to be honest, there's a pretty big buck in a lot of things that this rootless checks, we have plenty of them on the client where it makes no sense at all.\n\nBrent Baude: Fair enough. Matt, There's one other big one which is system connection.\n\nMatt Heon: Is this?\n\nBrent Baude: Is going to need to be rehammered out because it was not when John designed that. It was designed for remote and local. Basically, Yeah, I want to add a remote connection, I don't want to type it every time. And then we started using that for machine. so now we've got system connection. That is remote in every sense but it also could be different depending on the provider of the vert machine.\n\n00:45:00\n\nBrent Baude: And so the name of the connection is something like Podman Machine. Default when you don't name your VM, And it's theoretically possible to have Padman machine default with multiple providers. And then we get system connection collisions.\n\nBrent Baude: So we'll probably need to build some robustness into system connection, that allows a provider to be specified.\n\nPaul Holzinger: I would label this and containers.com free, right? And we don't want this in containers that All as you talked about, we don't run to write a containers of confile because that rewrites a personal config file of and you lose all comments. And so on what we mentioned,\n\nBrent Baude: Yep. Agreed.\n\nBrent Baude: Yeah, and maybe more of that needs to go into that world, so that's something and that theoretically could be breaking if we can't figure. To me, that's gonna probably be a breaking change, or we're gonna figure out. If machines are breaking changes, then there's no reason to try to compensate for system connections in my opinion. So,\n\nPaul Holzinger: I had a fun one today. Another interesting thing that's in our flagparticle, there's a thing called strength, light and string array. And I bet only a few people know what that means. what the difference is because if your past a gray flex, you have to chance to at the slice, you can call my separate values and there's an array. You just like I mean that's multiple times. And as it turns out, comma separated values are passed the field three and That is not heavy. If you pass in quotes and other stuff here. Yeah, if you have a regular t35, basically there are rules. And just today usually like this, incredible stupid syntax that you need to use.\n\nPaul Holzinger: If you have this dislike things and we have defined everywhere, for options that accept the five path, that means you cannot have a comma on the fire path and stuff like that.\n\nMatt Heon: We really should just have a litter to detect that. There are very few cases where you actually want string SL.\n\nPaul Holzinger: But the problem is ever noted on the issue, we cannot change. That's what operating somebody because the fees if you figure out the piece and text then you escape it with quotes and so on. but then that means the value, as soon as I change it to array, it's no longer the same That you get when you stream flies.\n\nMatt Heon: Five of stuff. we can break the small portion people who actually do these things. If I know this is the kind of thing where I would say I would argue. It's about Not even a breaking change but we can do it in five hours so we can do it anyway.\n\nPaul Holzinger: Yeah. That's\u2026\n\nTom Sweeney: Yep. Just looking at the clock and\u2026\n\nPaul Holzinger: where I'm getting it.\n\nTom Sweeney: we're seeming to grind on this just a little bit. do we have anything else? Major that needs to get in Can we create a discussion? Perhaps on the Github site for things you'd like to see in 5.0 or has one been created already?\n\nMatt Heon: I don't think we ever get up discussion. That's a good point. I think that we should probably have our internal discussions first, so we can populate. But once that's done, we can get something up and see what people think.\n\nMatt Heon: Completed also probably should have a blog about this, but yeah.\n\nTom Sweeney: Even myself have a place where people can just go ahead and put their ideas and go from there.\n\nPaul Holzinger: Yeah. What one thing if you say we have a deadline next summer, Then I think it's important to focus on stuff that require us some dragging changes because if they talk about features, we can add features at any point, if there are true features like a new command or something, that I think it would be important to allocate resources correctly so that we can get stuff that needs to happen forward and that cannot wait for\n\nPaul Holzinger: if I've got one more whatever.\n\nMatt Heon: Fair enough. We really need to get the docs start before we can start clarifying this. But yeah, I will see how soon I can carve us into the schedule because I think this is an important one start talking about,\n\nTom Sweeney: Like a girl. I think I'm gonna wrap up this particular discussion, Matt, unless you need to talk about anything else and just open up for any questions. Before we wrap up for the day that anybody else said related to this or anything else for that matter.\n\n00:50:00\n\nTom Sweeney: Very quiet. Last chance. Otherwise, I'll start.\n\nBrent Baude: Whether they come on,\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: you waited this long.\n\nTom Sweeney: Yeah. I'll just put in.\n\nTom Sweeney: Just a note for one. Our next meeting Got one coming up pretty quickly for the community meeting that's happening on Tuesday October 4th. I'm not sure that if any topics at this point for that one. So if you'd like to demo something there would love to have people do so. and then, The next cabal meeting will be on Thursday October 19th and both of those meetings will be on at 11 AM Eastern time and both will be daylight savings time. Still, I don't think we flip over until November for Daylight savings time. In this country anyway. And one last chance for questions comments.\n\nTom Sweeney: but otherwise, I'm gonna turn off the recording and we'll wrap that up.\n\nTom Sweeney: Right folks.\n\nTom Sweeney: That is the end of the recording.\n\nMeeting ended after 00:51:17 \ud83d\udc4b\n")))}Bi.isMDXComponent=!0;const Ci={},Di="Podman Community Meeting Notes",Pi=[{value:"October 3, 2023, 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-4)",id:"october-3-2023-1100-am-eastern-utc-4",level:2},{value:"Attendees (28 total)",id:"attendees-28-total",level:3},{value:"Topics",id:"topics",level:3},{value:"Meeting Start: 11:02 a.m. EDT",id:"meeting-start-1102-am-edt",level:2},{value:"Video Recording",id:"video-recording",level:3},{value:"Modules Demo/Intro",id:"modules-demointro",level:2},{value:"Valentin Rothberg",id:"valentin-rothberg",level:3},{value:"(2:02 in the video)",id:"202-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Demo - 3:25 in the video",id:"demo---325-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Allow specifying a guest OS in podman machine init",id:"allow-specifying-a-guest-os-in-podman-machine-init",level:2},{value:"Brent Baude",id:"brent-baude",level:3},{value:"(16:59 in the video)",id:"1659-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Demo - 20:22 in the video",id:"demo---2022-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Quadlet Demo",id:"quadlet-demo",level:2},{value:"Dan Walsh",id:"dan-walsh",level:3},{value:"(40:34 in the video)",id:"4034-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Open Forum/Questions?",id:"open-forumquestions",level:2},{value:"(55:10 in the video)",id:"5510-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Topics for Next Meeting",id:"topics-for-next-meeting",level:2},{value:"Next Meeting: Tuesday, December 5, 2023, 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-4)",id:"next-meeting-tuesday-december-5-2023-1100-am-eastern-utc-4",level:2},{value:"Next Cabal Meeting: Thursday, October 19, 2023, 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-5)",id:"next-cabal-meeting-thursday-october-19-2023-1100-am-eastern-utc-5",level:2},{value:"Meeting End: 12:08 p.m. Eastern (UTC-4)",id:"meeting-end-1208-pm-eastern-utc-4",level:3},{value:"Google Meet Chat copy/paste:",id:"google-meet-chat-copypaste",level:2},{value:"Raw Google Meet Transcription",id:"raw-google-meet-transcription",level:2}],Ni={toc:Pi},xi="wrapper";function ji(e){let{components:t,...n}=e;return(0,Ne.kt)(xi,(0,ce.Z)({},Ni,n,{components:t,mdxType:"MDXLayout"}),(0,Ne.kt)("h1",{id:"podman-community-meeting-notes"},"Podman Community Meeting Notes"),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"october-3-2023-1100-am-eastern-utc-4"},"October 3, 2023, 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-4)"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"attendees-28-total"},"Attendees (28 total)"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Aditya Rajan, Adrian De Jesus Perez Dominguez, Ashley Cui, Blaise Pabon, Brent Baude, Chetan Giradkar, Christopher Evich, Daniel Walsh, David Chisnall, Doug Rabson, Ed Maste, Ed Santiago Munoz, Gerry Seidman, Giuseppe Scrivano, Jad Bsaibes, Jake Correnti, Jennings, Johns Gresham, Kiran, Lokesh Mandvekar, Martin Jackson, Matt Heon, Miloslav Trmac, Mohan Boddu, Nalin Dahyabhai, Preethi Thomas, Tom Sweeney, Urvashi Mohnani, Valentin Rothberg, Ygal Blum"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"topics"},"Topics"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"1) Modules Demo/Intro - Valentin Rothberg\n2) Allow specifying a guest OS in podman machine init - Brent Baude\n3) Quadlet Demo - Dan Walsh"),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"meeting-start-1102-am-edt"},"Meeting Start: 11:02 a.m. EDT"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"video-recording"},"Video ",(0,Ne.kt)("a",{parentName:"h3",href:"https://youtu.be/kjsQVJRQlJU"},"Recording")),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"modules-demointro"},"Modules Demo/Intro"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"valentin-rothberg"},"Valentin Rothberg"),(0,Ne.kt)("h4",{id:"202-in-the-video"},"(2:02 in the video)"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Feature with the v4.7.0 release on Fedora and others.

This is the podman community meeting in this meeting, we generally discuss demos and the upcoming new items that are inside the project that we want to show up. For people want to show off or other projects that are dealing with pub man that want to show off their work as well. So if you have topics love to have them anytime in the future. For today, we're going to be talking about no, that's not that This is a meeting that goes on every First Tuesday of the month. We also have a couple meeting which has been going on on the third Tuesday of the month. It will go on the third Tuesday in this month. But going forward, we're moving that to the third Tuesday. Of the month as well. So on first Tuesday, will be the community meeting. The third Tuesday will be the call meeting. That will be starting for that one. and then topics are driven by car meetings or if you send requests to me,\nTom Sweeney: love to have topics at any point in time and we are willing to accept discussions on man build us copio or any related container projects, if using any of those part of your project, we'd love to have that as well. I have the meeting notes today that I've got a link there, audit and Google chat in a moment here. If you want to go ahead and correct anything I put in or add anything. And the presenters if you have links in particularly like that, love to have those edit there. And then for today's meeting, we are having a demo on modules and an intro from Valentin. And we'll have a discussion about you specifying, Guest, OS and poverty machine in it for Brent, and Daniel will be following up with the quadlet demo. And then for the last 10, 15 minutes, we'll have open topics for anybody. That has a topic that they want to talk about. Before we get too far, we have to have a note from our sponsor. If you haven't seen it yet, I've been in Action book by Daniel, Walsh's, excellent resource and Dennis caring this. But if you have a Red Hat subscription, you can get it for free online.\nTom Sweeney: And with that, I'm going to help over this bidding to Valentin the start of\nValentin Rothberg: All Sorry to click through the sharing before I apologies in advance. I gotta run in our own 20 minutes, so I won't be able to make it throughout the entire call. So thanks Tom for moving me first. So I want to talk about something that we call Containers Khan from modules. This is a feature that made it in the just recently released Portland for seven. and I think it's best explained with a motivating example. Use cases can be quite complex and there are loads of command line options and flex that you may need to use to run your certain workload. In this case here, I have an example where the workload, it's just an exemplary. One needs a lot of capabilities. There certainly more elegant solutions to do that. I'm going to show them in a minute.\nValentin Rothberg: But it boils down to some use cases need a lot of massaging. One motivating example or use case is for instance running or accessing graphics cards inside containers, which is very common in HPC use cases where the user is even need to mount certain launch amount certain and video libraries from the host into their containers because they don't want to ship All these huge libraries to keep the images as small as possible.\nValentin Rothberg: So it boils down to the command line, interface can be very complex. So if you want to run your containers on a number of nodes, either you're going to find a way to inject Generate these commands use config files or users need to be incredibly smart. typing a lot and make sure that there's no typo. So in this case here, we've just a Simple Container Using a Lot of Capabilities. One thing that we have an apartment space is a configuration file, which is called containers column. So if you go into the man pages of containers.com, you see a lot of options that you can find there and most of these options replay, certain command line flex. So in this case,\nValentin Rothberg: I'm using containers Conf to replace all the capabilities that we have before. And here we see one environment variable here, I'm using printf just to print all the environment variables inside the container. You see that it has been injected here from the host. How did I do that? And then it like that. So the environment variable has been injected here via the environment.\nValentin Rothberg: String array and all the capabilities have been injected via the array on top. So this works just fine. So you can use a containerscon file already today to set certain defaults if you want for the workloads that you want. You can do that per user. You can do that system wide. I then use a share if you want to ship it via for instance, rpm package or on Etsy. If your assistant men and want to configure it for you user base, but It's always a default setting. It sets the baseline. There has until 4.7 not been away to opt in certain.\n00:05:00\nValentin Rothberg: Configuration files enable them selectively other than specifying them environment variable as I just did on the command line flag. Use cases can be more complex than that. Maybe you need more than one configuration file. Maybe you want to separate them config options. You want to put in security Conf all in video related options. You want to put into Nvidia.com and at some point you may be want to compose them and use them all at once. selectively. So this is the use case that mod Solve. So, instead of specifying these environment or these config files over the environment.\nValentin Rothberg: there is a new root flag important - module where you can specify either an absolute path. If you specify an absolute path, then the file behind this absolute path will be loaded. And if you specify a relative path, then This relative path will be resolved to certain directories On the host. So,\nValentin Rothberg: To elaborate more on that here. If I move from my the module into my home, directory, can do this rootless if I want to in that containers conf dot modules. If I place it there and then use it after, I can totally do that. So, in this case, if I run here, we can see that the module is being resolved. Because first, we don't get an error and second, we get exactly the environment flag that we've seen before. So, I do not have an Nvidia card so I unfortunately cannot show a cool HPC for instance, workload using the new modules flag on national workstation here. But I hope I got the message and the idea across. So it's This new containers kind of modules, allow for enabling certain configurations.\nValentin Rothberg: And I believe it's a huge improvement over in terms of user experience because you do not need to use and recall. All these hundreds or dozens of depending on the command line flags. You can. Ship these containerscon files if you want to for all users. So if for instance, the capabilities con would not be in my home directory. But for instance, use a share or Etsy tain containers Conf modules, then it would be found there as well. So it's a Pretty simple Powerful means to ship. These settings, these defaults for your certain use cases, load them on demand. And I think that's it. So, I'm open to questions.\nTom Sweeney: Restriction. So the naming of the files.\nValentin Rothberg: They need to end With.com. this is pretty much The convention that we had before for containerscon files. One thing I should elaborate on. Probably as well, is that these confiles will be loaded in the specified order. So if you have module three, first one will be loaded, three will be loaded. So one thing that is probably worth mentioning as well, is that? during this loading sequence, if a configuration file, let's say configuration two would set the environment. Array, then previous settings will be overridden. so at the moment we're looking into and we have a proof of concept open at the moment against the containers common\n00:10:00\nValentin Rothberg: Get a project upstream where all the code for containers kind of lives. That allows for appending to these things. This is not something that Tamil natively supports, so we use tomal behind, it's a markup language. Behind containers gone. So we're working on improving the usability for these things and I should probably Call out the people who raise their hand.\nTom Sweeney: We'll go to Chris.\nValentin Rothberg: I see Chris\nChristopher Evich: Yeah, just quickly. This seems like this could get really complicated quickly with lots of modules and the orders significant and why not. This is a reasonably easy way to see What is loaded from where in the debug output for example,\nValentin Rothberg: yeah, that you will see in the debug output, which CONFIGS are our loaded from where But I agree for people probably shouldn't take this to an extreme and ship. dozens of conflicts with Fubar. but,\nValentin Rothberg: Looking at the state of the art today. If you have these very complex you want to use in videographic cards in your containers, what you got to do is either use and ship huge images and use a lot of command line flex, or normally sized images and still use a lot of command line flex. So in the future, there could be a future where you wouldn't install an RPM package, for instance pot man dash and video module or something like that. And it would just install a container's conf module in user share. And then if, you type Module Nvidia.com and everything's done, you don't have to care. No worry about this anymore or\nValentin Rothberg: if you have some security sensitive systems, you may use very strong defaults, but certain containers may still need to add certain capabilities or play a little bit with SEO Linux then it's probably where I would consider best practice to Ship Containers, Conf module which sets the base minimum of capabilities needed to run a certain works workloads rather than forcing or pushing users into using the privileged flag for instance. Yes, then as Dan says the Papa bear. Can't\nValentin Rothberg: Martin has another question.\nMartin Jackson: Yeah, this looks pretty cool. it looks like on current main. The module option is not yet supported in quadlets. do we have to pass that through with hot men arts? I like going forward?\nValentin Rothberg: That's a very good question. Yes, you're right at the moment, quality doesn't support. there's no quadlet native containers confield. So if you want to use it you got to use the department arcs cheat someone but it's actually a great request. Would you what you might opening an issue on Github so we want forget about it.\nMartin Jackson: I will happily do that.\nValentin Rothberg: Cheers.\nMartin Jackson: Thank you.\nValentin Rothberg: Another question from Eagle.\nYgal Blum: command line that you ran there, the argument was passed before the ran command does it matter where that can like that parameter is, or can it I'm just preparing myself to the club that PR\nValentin Rothberg: He has a quad limit. That's a very, very good question. the module flag needs to be specified before a command. So when you look in the terminal it\nValentin Rothberg: It needs to look like this. and\u2026\nYgal Blum: Yeah, and it can't look the other way around. Yeah.\nValentin Rothberg: not like this. So, I can give it 20 seconds. X or explanation of that.\nValentin Rothberg: To initialize, right?\nBrent Baude: And women request, if you could just Protocol your history so they can see the original command. To have your history still.\nValentin Rothberg: No. I run a shell script for the demo.\nBrent Baude: Okay.\nValentin Rothberg: But I can quickly jump through it. So what you saw here is the module flag. spec needs to be specified before any apartment command or subcommand. It has a technical reason. Which boils down to how the goal library that we use for CLI parsing works. And the fact that these containers confile are being used to set the defaults for these flags. So, we got a the module flag, very early on initialization of the potman very early on or right after the go run time. Has been initialized. To inject all these values. So,\n00:15:00\nValentin Rothberg: yeah, looking forward to see this and in Kuala.\nYgal Blum: Yeah, thanks.\nValentin Rothberg: Yeah, Great comment also, from Dan for those listening in, probably not reading or being able to read the chat, these modules work for any command. So this is not limited to Running containers is just a very compelling example but containers kind of allows for changing all kinds of fields and knobs important. So even when pulling an image, there are flex and fields in containers, confident influence that or when creating that works volumes, all kinds of things.\nTom Sweeney: I'm hearing the questions, slow down here and I know that Valentin's got to Make his way out of here, pretty soon. So, last chance, for the questions?\nValentin Rothberg: Thanks for the great questions and thanks everybody for joining. Back to you, Tom.\nTom Sweeney: Right thanks for coming in today and talking about that. So now next we have brent's up leading a discussion on specifying, a guest OS and podman machine admits\nBrent Baude: Why don't We'll start with David's demo, but to Set the stage, Perhaps a little bit. The David I believe You were the author of the PR or you're not Yeah.\nDavid Chisnall: Yeah.\nBrent Baude: And David has created a PR that opens up. Padman machine and knit to do.\nBrent Baude: Be able to load alternate os's. I think as we've debated this for weeks now. Internally I believe it kind of boils down to two things. One he's opens up the ability to be able to do FreeBSD. As a machine. And the other is that it opens up to be Able to do whatever you want as a machine. So with that, I think it's good that we look at what is PR does and then we can Talk about what? Am I mean?\nBrent Baude: We're getting a blank screen.\nTom Sweeney: And no sound from David. Who was on prior, I'm wondering if he's got chewed up by Google meet which sometimes takes people away.\nTom Sweeney: It's back. And David are you back now?\nBrent Baude: You're unmute David?\nDavid: Every time I try and share window, the\nDaniel Walsh: You're very low volume.\nBrent Baude: I provided the PR that we're talking about in the chat. for folks, If anyone wants to familiarize themselves with it, I think. Our team has debated it quite a bit, so we're quite familiar with it.\nTom Sweeney: David's, third time, the child.\nBrent Baude: Yes, it looks like it.\n00:20:00\nDaniel Walsh: David, if you're talking, we can't hear you.\nDavid: Sorry restarting the Web browser remuted me. So can people see a terminal window now?\nDaniel Walsh: Yes.\nDavid: So yeah, to Google meet thing kept crashing so I'm not sure. Quite what was said in the intro but my starting point here has been building on top of Doug Rabson's work to get podman working on FreeBSD. Most of what I've done has actually been on the FreeBSD side. I just had some very small patches to pop down to make all of this work. but what you can see, hopefully, here is a terminal on M2 macbook.\nDavid: And the thing that I've added is the ability to specify what the machine OS is, so that you can then key different behaviors of that. And there are a few places where currently Pubman hardcode some assumptions about specific target machines. so if we start this saying here is a FreeBSD disk image Let's boot up. PubMed machine for managing containers. This takes about 20 seconds. Last time, I ran it maybe a bit more with Google meet eating all the CPU.\nDavid: This does more or less. the same things that it does today with the next version, it mounts volumes from the host, provisions, ssh keys. And everything I did specify minus root full, but it doesn't actually propagate that setting and that's on my list of things to investigate. So I need to explicitly say past, this is as the root thing. but now, from the Mac, all the podman remote stuff works. So I can grab a FreeBSD container image. I can. And something in that that tells me what the version is.\nDavid: the kernel version is, BSD 15 current that container is from an older version. And mind mounts from the host of working. So, That's mounting the current directory in slash MNT and that shows the same things we see on the host.\nDavid: And for a little bit of extra fun, the previous image also has the Linux compact layer working. So I can also run the Linux command to look inside a Linux image.\nDavid: And if you run your name, you see that this is not actually a Linux can kernel. It's a FreeBSD kernel pretending to be a Linux kernel. So, this is kind of where I wanted to be able to Build use previously containers on the Mac. And that I can then deploy to servers that are running a freebs DOS on the host. That seemed like it was a hundred percent in scope for what podman machine was supposed to do. it's for supporting running containers of one OS, when the host is something different, that's why I was kind of surprised by how much negativity, there was in the PR but a couple of people suggested discussing it in this forum, so,\nDavid: Yeah. Yes, this is arm because I'm on a apple, silica Mac. Most of this stuff should work on x86, but my x86 Mac is too old for me to be able to build pod, man on it. The go compiler, crashes. So I haven't been able to test it on x86.\nBrent Baude: Okay.\nDaniel Walsh: So Paul is not here, So Paul is the one that push back the hottest.\nBrent Baude: No. I think we can speak for Paul. The team was pretty unified.\n00:25:00\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nBrent Baude: And in their thinking. So I'll try to represent the team the best David. And what I would like to do is just have a friendly conversation and please don't take anything as a negative.\nBrent Baude: So you're demo was very nice. it just Established a couple of facts. Podman machine and knit is not an automatic thing with tribute SD yet. Is it?\nDavid: You currently have to provide the image. It doesn't go infected automatically,\u2026\nBrent Baude: And is that image been customized?\nDavid: There's some build scripts that make that look as much. what you expect from a Linux guest, as possible. As I said, what I was trying to do with most of this work is minimize the disruption in Odd, Man, it's taking the ignition file. It's extracting the bits from that it needs. It's not adding, anything custom, my goal is to have the FreeBSD release engineering, team able to produce VM images that are the shape of man expects to be able to consume And I think EDM Matt from the previous D Foundation is on the call so he can maybe speak more to that. But the\nDavid: to go for most of this work. And this is why, the Pod man changes are a couple of hundred lines. The FreeBSD changes are significantly larger than that. As always been to make sure that we're not making undue requests from podman, we're not saying, Please change how you do sharing, how you provision? Ssh keys. We're just saying, Please don't make or provide a hook that lets us not use Linux specific mount commands, but export those with the free BSD ones and I think that the total changes I have\nDavid: Are really, about a hundred lines of code. And a big chunk of that is moving stuff from one function to another.\nBrent Baude: okay, so when you weren't to clarify, when you were talking about dealing with a free BSD, disk Images, Your intent I have an image that is not configured and would use ignition. Okay. How far away do you think you are from something like that?\nDavid: Yeah.\nDavid: So that's what we have. that image I build with poudreau\u2026\nBrent Baude: You do.\nDavid: which is the thing that the previous D project uses for building packages and can build this images. That's preconfigured to look for the ignition. And file in the qmu firmware, config exported space extract, SSH keys from that AD users based on that. It has the 9pfs stuff built in so it can grab the host shares from that. It installs podman from the packages,\u2026\nBrent Baude: Okay.\nDavid: it has all the services that's up to run all of those bits.\nDavid: And that's now scripted as a thing that just spits out a disk image that can be consumed by Bob Man. that's not where I want to end up. I'd like that to be something that the FreeBSD Release Engineering team is producing For every security advisory for every Iraq to notice.\nDavid: As they do with other customized disk images, for cloud providers and so on.\nTom Sweeney: Note for David and Brent is, did you see the note from Ed must. I'm hoping, I'm pronouncing his name correctly, It's last name. Anyway, he doesn't have a working. Mechan want to make a note that the foundation is quite interested in this topic and is willing to dedicate resources to support what we needed from the FreeBSD image. I can't speak English today either built side and I'm looking at some perfection uses of FreeBSD containerization in general. Ed works with you David? Is that true or previous?\nDavid: Yeah. So Ed is on the board of the FreeBSD Foundation and manages their technical activities.\n00:30:00\nDaniel Walsh: yeah, so I think it would be First ad for BSD support, I think the biggest pushback has been or against making prime machine end up being, some way of Downloading, any random, Unix Pat box and running it? and the main problem we have with that, is that we end up being the support people for I pulled down my machine for Ubuntu and it's not working properly and we don't have anything to do that. So if previous people are willing to support this I think it's something that we should definitely consider, again, we can't support it. So we need Doug and we need you David and anybody else from free, PSD to be able to support us. Doug.\nDoug Rabson: Hey, I'm absolutely there to support this feature and it's kind of interesting. The word support means different things in different contexts. And when I read the two, the four seven release notes includes a line for, adding support for DASH device on previously that absolutely doesn't mean that I expect Red Hat to support commercial customers using that feature. But it's nice that the Pod Binary supports it so I think we can have a sliding scale sort of context, depends. Support model in this case. David. And I really care about Having pod man work as well as it can on previous D and being able to use that on a Mac. Just opens up people to experiment with it. I have a Mac on my desk at home that I'm working. So, we'll be useful for me, but it doesn't mean that I expect you to,\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: I just want to.\nDoug Rabson: to feel support calls for that future.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, I don't want to first of all, Red Hat support and just because a few bunch of us were for redhead Red Hat supports a totally different thing. We're always talking about here is upstream support. And in that case everything you just said actually is true as well. Our fear is that Doug you've been a great partner for us so you're not as category but we get a lot of drive by commits that has my favorite Linux distribution. I need a machine for it. So here's how to do an alpine machine and then that person disappears and all of a sudden we're getting, github issues on it and we're closing it and people like I man sucks it doesn't support Alpine right or, things like that. So that's probably the biggest pushback or,\u2026\nBrent Baude: Okay, wait,\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: at least my biggest push back.\nBrent Baude: we really designed Purposely an appliance such that we could have this conversation of you don't get to just put whatever you want in there and\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: \nBrent Baude: have us figure it out. So, that was a defensive maneuver at least, when I wrote the original code. IQ IQ. And I think the team as well with some mattresses. Feels pretty good about the freebies steam machine part. So, the hangup is on the BSD machine, if you I think our wish would be that if you follow the code pass, there's something called a provider. In our code. We'd like to see free. BSD be a provider even though it's using If that's something we can maybe figure out and I need to go back and look at the code to see if that's possible or we just sort of talk it, under there as a OS. everything under square\nDavid: Yeah, so I mean the Current.\nBrent Baude: UNIX, or whatever.\nDavid: Delta between Linux and 3bsd in qmu is two things. One of which I'd like to not need for some reason on a arch.\nBrent Baude: Okay.\nDavid: 64 FreeBSD is not correctly. Handling, the ACPI Shut down event. There's a bug filed about that ream. Maybe Ed can help. Devote some resources to fixing that, but that means we just ssh in and do a shut down dash p now, as well as sending that event. that's three lines of code on two of those are the open brace and closed brace If it's Free BSD, have this hacky work around\n00:35:00\nDavid: the other one is when we mount the host file systems, The FreeBSD, and the Linux Mount commands takes slightly different arguments. I factored that out into a separate function for the Linux and\u2026\nBrent Baude: We?\nDavid: the Freebs D1. And everything else is shared across the qme1.\nBrent Baude: Perfect.\nDavid: I haven't tried the Apple HP code paths yet. I'm not sure how mature they are if they're in a working state but I'd love to work on that. I know some customers that would be very happy to have. No requirement to run GPL codes to be able to run containers on a Mac. I don't have quite that hang up so I'm happy to work with the qmu version.\nBrent Baude: I wrote the Apple HP stuff, so it's perfect obviously. It does work, the biggest hang up with Apple HP. Right now is just simply that we don't have photo or cos image being generated by a fedora correlas. So otherwise it's been pretty bulletproof. It does use vfkit. have you seen that? Okay, and\u2026\nDavid: Yeah. In a past life,\u2026\nBrent Baude: it uses GT proxy.\nDavid: I actually wrote the book about the Zen internal, so I have more than a passing familiarity with how hypervisor work.\nBrent Baude: so that would be the only You think of a free bsd problem of via Kit? I would imagine that would boot just fine. They're red Hatters so we can get cooperation. There.\nBrent Baude: And I think they even let me merge Prs. so, the second small hurdle will have to figure out is somehow one of our biggest efforts right now as a team, As Chris can tell, you is, We're trying to get machines, we have a whole slew of machine tests. Now, And we're trying to get that working in CI. so, the first thing that might be good is to Have you run your current code against the machine tests? There's a readme in there. I think you'll be able to figure it out.\nBrent Baude: If not hit me on IRC here wherever else? But we don't really have a freebsdci solution. Is that something you guys have?\nDavid: Yeah I mean Sarah Ci does open source Freebsdci but the bit that we actually need here is Mac CI. And we can provide FreeBSD.\nChristopher Evich: He?\nDavid: This images that can integrate with that.\nChristopher Evich: I can speak a little bit to that. So, serous, the serious FreeBSD, I believe, that's using their compute services and I'm pretty sure that's going to be running on a VM of some sort. So, that seems like that would cause issues with trying to run nested for and\nDavid: Yeah.\nDavid: I thought she supported nested virtualization, but I've not actually tried it.\nChristopher Evich: Sue and So I'm not exactly sure what is behind the serous compute stuff? It's kind of a black box. but you're right there are I think in both GCE and in AWS, I think they've got\nChristopher Evich: Images that are available. The ez2 side is a bit more attractive because we could in theory, run bare metal there. It's kind of expensive, but\nChristopher Evich: Maybe that's a possibility.\nBrent Baude: So let's get it.\nDavid: But yeah.\nBrent Baude: Can we get an issue upstream about implementing? this and Chris Knight, This is the last of your\nChristopher Evich: yeah, You can stick me on it.\nTom Sweeney: Okay.\nBrent Baude: But it would be the last of your platforms to work on it. At least at this\u2026\nChristopher Evich: Yeah.\nBrent Baude: but David, if we can get a thumbs up, that it passes the tests if you run it, local, That would be,\u2026\nDavid: Yeah.\nBrent Baude: that would be very helpful to us. In terms of confidence.\nDavid: Yeah, if you can drop me a link in the chat to the Readme that has the instructions. I can definitely spend some time on it this weekend.\nTom Sweeney: Okay, that's good. I wanted to just touch base with Doug real quick and then we're gonna have to move on if we want to come back to this at the end we can't, did you have something further to talk about here?\nDoug Rabson: Yeah. I was just going to note that in a very small way. We have a FreeBSD workload running in the CI does the native through the SD build as opposed to a cross build obviously it's not doing nested virtual anything like complicated Long-term, I kind of want to be able to run system tests, but I think we're quite our way away from that.\n00:40:00\nTom Sweeney: I'm just gonna end this conversation right now just because of time rather than of interest.\nBrent Baude: Yeah.\nTom Sweeney: And I'm going to ask Dan to step up now and give us a quiet demo and then we can come back to the Select Demo style if we still want to. 10.\nDaniel Walsh: Okay, so I was talking in time before it's a quad that's been around for a little while. I'm surprised we haven't done this at community meeting. So let me I'm just going to talk through quickly. What quadlet is and Show you a couple of examples of it. Those who haven't played with it yet.\nDaniel Walsh: So, a little history lesson, I wrote a blog on Quad, led Pod that back February of this year. So quadlet was a effort of integration of podman and system D. So for those of you out there that played with partners, always have this command, Baude man system. System degenerate, which would take a running containers on your system or running pods in your system and then would generate a system to unit file. That was sort of the best practices of the time to define how to run this pod man under a system to unifile. And\nDaniel Walsh: That a lot of people use that matter fact, that somebody who we've sort of tried to deprecate it and now there's some people pushing back as they use it heavily inside of production. So we're have to look at it. But a engineer from Red Hat, Alex, Larson saw this and actually realize that he understood the system. He had this concept of what's called the generator and what a generated allows you to do is actually sort of do that on the fly, all Actually generate a unit file and then customize the way that the unit file actually looked on a system. So if you played with system D at all, he probably seen a unit file that looks something like this.\nDaniel Walsh: And usually a unit file defines the actual application and find some stuff under services. And then usually Elijah to set up relationships between different unifiles. So you can do things like install and say, the services are going to start till after the civil service starts, but there's a special section inside of this. That doesn't exist in most system to Unifiles. And this section can be defined, and then you run a generator to convert this section into something that looks like in a system D could actually support. So what quadlet does is allows us to specify these special sections inside of what looks like a traditional system. The unit file in this case is just a couple of lines What image the container is going to run. And then just the command to execute inside the container.\nDaniel Walsh: When you run a system daemon reload that will actually cause system D to run a generator, which is going to run quadlet to translate that thing that looks like a system. To, file, we call them quadlets into a real system to unit file and I think down the bottom here. this is the real system to unifologist generated here and you'll see\nDaniel Walsh: Basically, that gent takes generates it into a podman command that will run and your services. But this builds in all the intelligence that we've added to make sure that Pod man runs correctly on the system to unit files. So the original one was just to do, simple, quadlets containers underneath unit files, There's a second blog that was written by Ygal on this call. Also that looks at advanced features of quadlet, so we don't only support container. But we actually support Dot Coop, which allows you to specify Kubernetes, Yaml file to run inside of a quad. that's going to use Pod, man, who play underneath the covers and then there's additional tools Dot network and Dot volume. Let's that allow you to specify, to create a pod man that work or create a Pie Man volume. And then you can into mix all these together and this\nDaniel Walsh: The blog Goes heavily into How to set up a real complex, Kubernetes Yml file with its own networking, in its own volumes, but all created, by these multiple different files underneath the Kubernetes Yaml files. So now, I'm gonna go out and show you another example. So, in my home directory, this is big enough. Everybody to see I created a quadlet for running Android. So, this is a\n00:45:00\nDaniel Walsh: A quick quadlet that someone has Android VM to be able to run inside of a container underneath the pod, man, and this gives you an idea of right up here on doing some leaking the environment variable to tell it which look for Wayland to my desktop. Then I'm adding a couple of it needs KVM and renderer and a few other commands to be able to run container. It's kind of interesting that you can actually do things like Advanced concepts. I think percent takes the current xdg runtime directory and mouse it into the container. So this advanced up but basically this is all this stuff is going to get converted into a real complex pod man. and to run but again it's fairly simple to look at and then I can just do A start.\nDaniel Walsh: Android and basically standard system, the commands to actually process a quadlet. And there you have Android running underneath Pod Man, inside of a container on my desktop, it takes a couple of seconds to refresh.\nDaniel Walsh: Here it comes.\nDaniel Walsh: And say it was giving me this severely real fast, but There are some stuff that we can do to improve the speed of this, but Now, you have an This is Android Auto,\u2026\nTom Sweeney: But yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: so a lot of this was done for the Auto SD code. So this eventually shows you, Yes, that running. So now I'm gonna go into quickly through some slides of some of the power that you can do with quadlets because quad lights, allows you to integrate system setting up parts of the system as well as setting up containers. And now you can interact between the two of them. So this is actually part of the ribose effort, red and vehicle operating system and we're looking for\nDaniel Walsh: Up a section of the disk to isolate processes inside of this section, from the rest of the system. And so I'm just going to go through one of the things we can do is we can name sort of the C group that we're gonna associate with the entire service. We can actually take through all system D tools that you can use to convey a quadlet. We can actually pin all the processes inside of this broad led to specific CPUs and the system you can actually set up C groups measurements on the group. So you can set up CPU weight. Now you can set this up in five man as well but it's kind of interesting that System has some advanced features that we can take advantage of i08 similar\nDaniel Walsh: On and we're gonna go down here. We can actually set things like boom killer. So if I want to make sure that my process gets killed inside of a container, I can set up outside of this service is priority wise. They can do that a couple of those things.\nDaniel Walsh: We can actually take set stuff like recent whether or not system should restart the service automatically. And this is interesting too system. D has advanced features for stopping fork bombs. So Taskmax here is actually setting, basically says the service to say that it can never have more than 50% of the maximum amount of kids on the system. And then we're going to jump down.\nDaniel Walsh: And now we're in the container section. So these are commands to setting up pod man, but when I set up the pid's limits there, what's interesting? I think I stopped here as I can soon section. These are all flags, you can set But I was trying to get to and I guess my presentation. So right here, Pid's limit If I wanted a container to have more than,\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah. The Pid's limit, if I wanted to control his limits from my system point of view, and not from podman's, hide coded to go to 2048 by default that runs containers. But if I wanted to have 50% of all CPUs and I go into my Pod, Man section and tell it to set the limits to minus one. Now, most of these fields inside of the container section, all match up some what to match up to similar Pod, Man. Command line options and there is a Get Out of Jail free card. If we did an implement one. So there is a podman arc so you can actually specify individual pod, Commands bottom line is, you can do really advanced stuff with running podman of the system d. So if you're moving to services running on nodes edge devices, things like that is incredible power on this. So I'm gonna end it.\n00:50:00\nDaniel Walsh: End at this point and open myself up to questions I guess.\nTom Sweeney: Any questions for dinner. I saw a couple go by, for Blaise in the comments talking about Now, I've lost it.\nTom Sweeney: Always quiet, Kubernetes for humans. In other words, a poor man's Kubernetes\nDaniel Walsh: Here. you still have to write the Kubernetes Yaml files. Although Pod, Man has ability to generate Kubernetes Yaml files so you can do podman Coop generate from existing pods of containers and that'll generate a yaml file that you can then use in a pod man and inside of a quadlet and Egal is much more of an expert on this. So I'm sure he's jumping up to answer the question so go, yeah.\nYgal Blum: But I'm I think might I have a problem with my camera, Sorry for that. So the idea is that you can define your application either directly on a containers as a dot container or it is a dot cube and then use it as a kubernetesmo and then point to it with a dot cube file, the ideas that then you can reuse your already existing Kubernetes deployment or even said or whatnot and use it directly and you don't need to maintain two sources of truth.\nYgal Blum: An image pool operation that will be separated from the apartment run. the initial reason I added It was that I needed a weight. I wanted to create a volume based on an image and unlike Podman Run which knows All the Image Podium volume. Create does not do So I needed an automated way to pull the image separately from the creation of the volume. So this allowed me to do that and not sure if Dan mentioned it. So there's an if you can see it in my blog post, Once the Dot volume. And next DOT image file are not only used to define these entities, but they can also be used in the Dot cube or DOT container or next in the DOT volume using DOT image file. So that\nYgal Blum: Quartet will know to create the link between them and also to create a dependency between the service file. So let's say I have a network created by a DOT network file and I point to it from a DOT container file, then while that will know to link to that network and also to create a dependency between the service created for the DOT container file and the one created for the DOT network.\nDaniel Walsh: Excellent. They got somebody's pointing out that there's multiple ways of running containers.\nTom Sweeney: Yes.\nDaniel Walsh: There's Kubernetes There's Darker compose, there's pod, man system degenerate and now I think quadlet is biased towards system. D, use cases for running containers and we've always had a goal with pod man to make it as integrated with System. B is as humanly possible, the real neat thing is that you can start to run, could you Kubernetes workloads? I mean, define your application in terms of Kubernetes, then we can run at locally under a system, as well as running inside of a Kubernetes cluster. So we can actually run the gamut of those tools. Obviously we continue to support compose and kubernels for running. container as well, but\n00:55:00\nDaniel Walsh: So that's it. Any other questions I missed anything?\nTom Sweeney: I'm hearing silence and we're getting close to the end of the hour. So I'm gonna think that and you go for talking through this and the questions that we got on it and I will just ask if there are any questions that somebody else had Kiran\nKiran: Hi, Tom. so my question is regarding I deployed my container. but, I was thinking to add authentication for it. If any user is using Portman exec command we can directly get inside the container. So is there a way to add any type of authentication for that?\nDaniel Walsh: Do you want to You running a ruler container or focus data.\nKiran: it is a rootless container.\nDaniel Walsh: So you're worried about other people logged into that user getting in or is your container listening on the network?\nKiran: I'm worried about the other user, specially the root user. To access my container.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, so that if you were worried about the root user, the future of that type of worry Pod, man has no way of control and I'm back. No process on a Linux system. Right now has a way of controlling that if you following along with the thing called confidential computing, which is just starting to show up right now and Computing is the way to solve that problem, but it takes specific types of hardware that are not available on laptops or low-end devices yet, but I think over the next six to nine months so this would be So the processes inside of your container as well as all the content would be encrypted in such a way that the root process would not be able to interfere with it. the only you could do is kill it but you wouldn't be able to examine the content or manipulate it so\nKiran: Okay, so I'm mostly concerned about my source code, which is inside using the Portman secret.\nDaniel Walsh: yeah.\nKiran: Can I hide all of my source code?\nDaniel Walsh: No Secret is only to leak a secret into the containers in a way that it would not be saved. So It's really a secret from the image that could be created. So secret secrets is not what you think it is. Now you could encrypt your container and pass in a secret to decrypt, your content. But that would not make it safe from the reviews around the system.\nKiran: Thank you, Daniel.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah. Yeah.\nTom Sweeney: Thanks.\nDaniel Walsh: Jennings is a hand raised. Go Jennings.\nTom Sweeney: hope to do, just\nTom Sweeney: We can go a few more minutes.\nJennings: Okay. Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: If your questions between me and lunch, so yeah. but,\nJennings: So I have a really long question. That's really multiple questions. First, I can share that I've been using Quad lit, just on my personal home server and I've been able to deploy next cloud, using quad lit and so far. It's been running smoothly, but I do have a couple of bugs that I need to work around. One of them has to do with podman network create and When I created the issue on, the podman Github, they close that as won't fix. So I'm just trying to explore other options. I've seen this word pasta appear like on the issue boards but I've never found any documentation for it. Can anyone tell me what pasta is and is it something that I could possibly look into\nDaniel Walsh: but,\nBrent Baude: Pasta is a replacement for the current slurp. Implementation. It's claim to fame is that it's more performant.\nBrent Baude: Maybe you could paste the issue so that we can familiarize ourself with the issue.\nJennings: Yeah. I'm looking for,\nJennings: There we go. So that's the issue with podman that I have. How the On quadlet thing for me works is that this is a special repository called Next Cloud. All-in-one A little context on what Next Cloud is a self-hosted, Google Drive and this next cloud, all in one project works by speaking to the Docker Damon and creating some containers of its own. I found this pretty easy to do with quadlet and also rather elegant to do because as a System D service, the dot container file can actually specify a dependency on the podman socket. And so I'm able to just bring everything up with a system restart or as a system CTL start. But then, we get to this problem where? The application called Nextcloud Aio wants to speak to the Docker.\n01:00:00\nJennings: API and podman understands most of the things. But in counters, A Internal error with this specific issue. I wanted to create a workaround in next Cloud Aio, but they just shot down my PR as well.\nChristopher Evich: I was exploring that the other day and I saw that there's a little blurb on their website. That basically says that they don't want to support Pod man because of differences with the docker API. They don't enumerate what those differences are which is not helpful.\nBrent Baude: What is the difference?\nChristopher Evich: We don't know, It just says Next Cloud. Aio does not currently support podman due to differences with the Docker API. it's very generic like that.\nBrent Baude: Is that what you're seeing Jennings?\nJennings: The API is the same but the behavior is different. So you can make the proper API call but it's not going to work because of this. Issue with Slurp and I'm not sure if it's truly something like that I can't figure out or whether or not, it's been closed by won't fix erroneously.\nBrent Baude: Paul's not here to speak for himself so I'm not going to speculate He's one.\nMatt Heon: I can.\nBrent Baude: Smart cookie.\nMatt Heon: I can say it on the sprint. This is mostly internal database stuff there are,\u2026\nBrent Baude: Yep.\nMatt Heon: it's an accounting thing, where the sloper knit in this net mode doesn't allow for a list of networks.\nMatt Heon: I think it's definitely fixable but this is refactor stuff that will probably go along with the rewrite for pasta. So I don't think it's fixed by pasta, but I do think that we're actively working on this bit of code as part of the posture transition.\nBrent Baude: And all is working on that presently. So, we could take a note to follow up with Paul.\nBrent Baude: To see if that's something. He can consider. Is that what your sort of suggesting Matt?\nBrent Baude: And he's in Germany. So he's on PTO today. There's a holiday.\nChristopher Evich: It seems like it would be useful for us to get details from the next Cloud people. What exactly in the API is not matching because there's my understanding as we want to try to have problem and be close.\nChristopher Evich: So, if it's\nJennings: To try to save you from that conversation. I'm pretty sure what they just mean. Is they are Skeptical and it's more work for them to maintain something that is somewhat niche in their community right now.\nChristopher Evich: Yeah. Yeah.\nJennings: Everyone's happy just running docker, as the root user and they make rootless locker, a special case as well. And then podman is a special case of a special case. And they just don't have the manpower to tease out these tiny little bugs that are different between docker and podman. So this issue that I created on the podman repository it does seem like a difference or broken feature parity to me because it's very easy to reproduce but I can see that this is also just a very rare edge case since trying to join in existing container to a existing network. Isn't something that most people will do very often\nDaniel Walsh: Then.\nJennings: if we do have a solution for this bug, down the road, after a pasta rework and then after some more effort on this issue, then, I would say This bug is the last thing that's kind of blocking specifically mixed cloud aio from working with Quad lit in a very elegant way. so, If this issue is at a result, then I would probably be able to contribute to the next Repository just the set of quality files that I used to bring everything up and it'll be a seamless experience for other people to try.\n01:05:00\nChristopher Evich: Or a blog article would be good.\nJennings: Yeah. the next cloud Aio Maintainer invited me to write a wiki page. I haven't, really once again, things work out of the box. So, long as you work around this one bug by just changing, two lines of source code.\nTom Sweeney: All right, I think I'm going to wrap up here just due to time. Jennings is there anything else that we can do at the moment or for you or help you with this? Or just continue on the bus.\nBrent Baude: Let's try to circle back, Jennings. Are you on discord or IRC or something? Where we can circle back to you later in the week?\nJennings: I am on the Matrix channel.\nBrent Baude: Okay, great.\nTom Sweeney: As Jennings.\nTom Sweeney: Sounds good. Any other last questions before we wrap up for today?\nTom Sweeney: Okay, I'll just throw up the reminders for upcoming meetings. We are December 5th for the community meeting here.

Anders and others representing too Avery will be looking talking about building trust and containers. And then Brent will be talking about public machine. Ssh keys connections and namespacing and then as time will also be doing a very quick update from what I hear about allowing specifying, a guestos and quad man mission with the talent. So with that, we've got a rather pack schedule, I'm going to hand it over to Anders.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah, I hope you can hear me, And I was,\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Yep, coming through that.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: I was talking to the podman desktop team about different ways of Being able to build and run containers.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Since the one that already they have a workflow. When they have a podman machine, they start with cores and interact with it and you run your containers and you deploy a couple of pods and so on. And then you want to deploy them to Kubernetes and then they have the option of starting a kind container in Podma. and this can continue with unrunner container D inside this container, but that also means that every time you want to build a new image, you have to do podman build, and then you have to do POD month save, And then you have to load this saved archive into the community's cluster with the CTR import or some other containerdy command.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: So we were talking about different alternatives than one alternative would be to have the portman desktop, talk directly to The podman inside the cluster so it would talk to the prodman inside the container support, man in podman if you would but it's an older version and you would still not be able to use your images that you had in the other GUI. So the question from the team was, if it was a possible to share the storage. from the PORTMAN engine on the host with Trial engine running in a container on that same VM host.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: That is something we started to explore. I haven't gone so far with myself, I think? Mini cube in podman with player with a bit out of date and has a number of barges. So\nDaniel Walsh: So, she would launch a pride privilege container inside of Right,\u2026\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: So kind only runs contain a D and\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: kind? And then have Apartment.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: that makes sharing images between container D and putman and in probably more of a no-go. but, An alternative would be to start mini-cube. Container with cryo. And very similar fashion and then have that\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: Yep.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: share the storage. So I was wondering is it enough to volume The Continuous storage from the house or How many other interesting issues really run into one year when you have two engines fighting over the same storage?\nDaniel Walsh: I did I have a feeling it would work.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Because we have used it on singing machine. We use podman to do podman build and portman load and then use those images in trial.\nDaniel Walsh: Right, right? The container storage itself to be able to do to handle that situation.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: As long as they're in the same username space and things like that.\nMiloslav Trmac: adding up,\u2026\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: I,\nDaniel Walsh: but,\nMiloslav Trmac: they used to do builds in the storage shared with cryo We eventually isolated it but if I remember correctly, this did work at some point. But I have no idea how much thicker was involved.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: And the initial approach would be to run the route full hortman machine.\nDaniel Walsh: I think.\n00:05:00\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: To cut down on the number of moving pieces. I think eventually you can have a root left Kubernetes cluster to torque into rootless container engine but Since it's all running in a VM,\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: that's not the priority.\nMiloslav Trmac: Okay, if you are selling storage then the build container. The supposedly are privileged one has full privileges of cryo anyway for the most part. That's not presentation to be a resident against malicious trade.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah, that is true.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Of course.\nDaniel Walsh: the only issue I would see in this is, Some Kubernetes likes to monitor now to the images and storage and Sometimes Kubernetes likes to come in and\u2026\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: say I didn't that. Get it out of there, all right.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah, yeah. What is correctly? The cube that will start garbage collecting the problem machine. So that's something to look out for.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: I think with a newer version, you can pin them different images that you care about, but it's also only support to start deleting stuff when you're run out of disk. So allocating a bigger image for machine might have\nDaniel Walsh: But how out of date is the pod man that's inside of the machine.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: It's open to container so it's three four. Something\nDaniel Walsh: So three, four we even have a service for three foot. probably the service Because pushing an image to contain a storage, probably would work even with that big. It just mismatch\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah yeah I mean the basics work but There'd be no fancy things.\nDaniel Walsh: and the man, another you could do with Microshift as well. Michael Shift might be a little more.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah, yeah You can do the open Shift cluster instead and not to deploy Kubernetes cluster at all that could cause but that is something that is being looked into because for different reasons. Podman desktop might want to be able to run with cryo And not you.\nDaniel Walsh: I think the \u2026\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Containing the Olympian.\nDaniel Walsh: with trial, you don't have a problem. All the container storage locking is done. Inside that we don't use any. Time profess any content in slash run, so that shouldn't be a problem.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: But you do need both of our and\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: So, as long as you have the right, it should be right.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: run, right? So you need to run route and the route To have the looks and everything in place.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: I need to.\nDaniel Walsh: You have to nalin, do you know if they're I don't think container storage does any locking in?\nNalin Dahyabhai: It doesn't look like miles in the run route.\nDaniel Walsh: And slash run.\nNalin Dahyabhai: It stores them under the root. That's why it has to be rewrite. So I expected will work. But yeah, the main thing I would worry about is garbage. Collecting From one,\u2026\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah, and\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: I think that's a later concern,\u2026\nNalin Dahyabhai: the other.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: but it's going. With a Kubernetes 129 it started to garbage collect the pause image in Doctor that's interesting for,\u2026\nNalin Dahyabhai: Wow.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: for those. So Let's say it may around this area with the back, parting the support for pin the containers, otherwise there will be garbage collecting.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: But the post image is small, you can pull it quickly. Yeah. And now that was just a topic. I linked in Russia, link to the meaning here issue. And the alternatives and so on. If you are interested in this, I think it will be ongoing minikub. I'm not sure how much the podman desktop team will be involved in it other than trying to make it work that interface, but\nDaniel Walsh: Just gonna give Mini Cube to move to Cryo get off of Rebuntu. Okay.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: You mean to I think kind change their container from Ubuntu to Debian. So the mini cube container is just suffering,\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: a bit of neglect, it doesn't moved in a way.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: But natural also be possible right now.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah. A little more.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: It's sharing the image between all the run times. So it runs Dr. And container and trial And the cryo will pull it out of date. I think it's like 124 or something. It's supposed to be I mean,\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: reasonably within versions of the Kubernetes. and they are now started to release cryo in lockstep with Kubernetes, so each, Kubernetes release will have a player release\n00:10:00\nTom Sweeney: Any other thoughts or comments here? So, we move on.\nTom Sweeney: Anders you mentioned a link but I don't see it in the chat.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Sorry, it was in the documents in the Hack MD.\nTom Sweeney: Okay.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: As I can post it in the chat as well, but\nTom Sweeney: I got Brancha.\nTom Sweeney: those to the notes and thank you. So next up we're going to be talking about building trust and containers Avery.\nAvery Blanchard: Hi, thank you. I'm going to share my screen if that's okay.\nTom Sweeney: Sure thing. If the meeting gods will allow it.\nAvery Blanchard: All right, great.\nTom Sweeney: Looks good coming through just fine. And would you mind sending me this? So after the meeting PDF or\u2026\nAvery Blanchard: Yes. Yes,\u2026\nTom Sweeney: something, thank you.\nAvery Blanchard: so high, I'm Avery. I'm a first year PhD student at Duke. and I'm going to be talking about our ongoing efforts to build trust in containers.\nAvery Blanchard: and so, Our proposed solution is centered around leveraging, on the power of cryptographic measurements, rooted and trusted hardware. So, we're working from inside the operating system, to use, cryptographic measurements, and attestation to build a framework for verifying container integrity. and so, I started this work actually as a Red Hat, intern. So, it's fun to be back So, here's a background on some of the technologies that we're using to build the solution. So we use the Trusted Platform module, and so the Trusted Platform module serves as a dedicated cryptographic program processor designed to secure hardware. Some of the key components that we're using in this solution are secure storage and unique hardware identities.\nAvery Blanchard: So Tpms contain a number of platform. Configuration registers that can be changed by firmware in the OS only by concatenating With the prior value held in the register. The TPM is used in applications. Such as secure boot, disk encryption, and attestation and trust through technologies, like Key Lime.\nAvery Blanchard: The Linux integrity measurement architecture is used to file integrity throughout runtime. This currently cannot be used on containers because Does the measurement appraisal and storage of file integrity data. These measurements are provoked when files are mapped with an executable protocol and I'm a creates a hash of the file contents and stores them in non-reputable logs. These files can be measured based on system policy and are used to detect changes in file integrity due to remote or local attacks.\nAvery Blanchard: And for some more background attestation involves the verification of system. Integrity relying on these cryptographic measurements and trusted hardware, the TPM ens remote attestation from boot measurements throughout runtime using I'm a logs and the measurements conducted by IMA throughout runtime. You see, a diagram here of how keyline can be used to attest an environment through registration and verification of I'm a logs using a TPM quote.\nAvery Blanchard: And so in our solutions we use a variety of kernel extensions are users find programs loaded into the Kernel kernel modules are used for adding device drivers or file systems to load into the OS. We also use EVPF which is a mechanism that allows for user-defined programs to run sandboxed in the operating system kernel. And so this is useful for a variety of applications because of the wide, variety of hooks located across kernel subsystems.\nAvery Blanchard: And so the first step of finding the solution was extending, I'ma to containers using ebpf. This was possible through the Ellison hook in that file which We used in order to grab the files that were mapped, as executable through an ebpf hook that we placed and then setting a call back to the kernel module that we defined to add namespacing to this measurement. This is important because as I said, previously, I'm currently does not have names, say support in the kernel and due to this, we were unable to verify the integrity of individual containers from these measurements because you can't differentiate between a host measurement and measurement of a container. And so through leveraging the kernel support of Evpf, we can add namespace support without requiring changes to the kernel.\n00:15:00\nAvery Blanchard: So, Evpf provides the visibility that we needed to. Measure a container's executable content without requiring changes to the OS. We used to sleepable Evpf program to hook into the IMAP file LSM which is actually the same ellison hook used by IMA to provoke measurements inside the kernel. And so, we used a patch that was available in Kernel 6.0, which allowed ebpf programs to use kernel module functions. And so, in our kernel module, we defined the routines for measuring and storing integrity data. We did this through utilizing some existing, I'm infrastructure and we added namespacing to these measurements. And extended them all to the host, hardware TPM, while rather than having a TPM per container.\nAvery Blanchard: and so, from here, we have measurements of a container's executable content throughout runtime but as you can imagine doing attestation for a system this is Extremely complex. It requires building a policy for each container that would run on the system. So, while we have this integrity measurement for the containers, what can we do with them? It becomes more and more complex to do attestation at the scale. so We seem to be kind of at a crossroads of how can we measure container integrity? Which led us to our next solution. And so, from the operating system, you have very little visibility into container creation.\nAvery Blanchard: And so we're using the unshare system call, which is central to container virtualization, we're able to have a little bit of visibility from the operating system level. So the unshare system call just associates parts of processes. Execution context that are currently being shared And so through, looking at the unshare system call, we can filter based on policy to have visibility into the container creation process. And so from Unshare, we're able to see the current task that is being disassociated. And when we're looking at this task, the file system of the task is the container image that is being started. So from Unshare, We're able to get the information of the new namespace that is being created for this container, as well as the container image, that is being started.\nAvery Blanchard: and so, We added a LSM hook into the unshare system. Call to provoke this measurement, Based off of a policy. And so this hook provides a callback to functions that we have defined in IMA to measure the container image based off of the policy. The introduction of this hook also allows for future, work on appraisal and access control from the operating system level.\nAvery Blanchard: And so, as we talked about the complexity of creating a policy for container attestation Having these, I'm a measurements of a container and a log just means that the analog is just going to grow increasingly with the scale of the container. And so having a single measurement for each image, really cuts down on this complexity and so we propose a single measurement for the image which is created through traversing the file system and concatenating. After each measurement, we do a depth first traversal of the image file system and form a single measurement for the container that we then write to the IMO log with its associated namespace.\nAvery Blanchard: And so these image digests are stored as a single entry, they are logged with a namespace as they're identifier, and they are extended to the PCR of the TPM. This image might be small, but you can see that a container image was measured with its namespace. This image also shows the imextension where it executed something called And so you can see the differentiation between a system with namespacing. Versus not.\n00:20:00\nAvery Blanchard: And so, We're also working on policy enforcement. And so to measure this based off policy unshares being called for more than just container creation. And so having a system policy that can be changed dynamically is what we would need to Determine what flags would provoke a measurement or what environment would need to be measured. When unshare is called,\nAvery Blanchard: and so, the overhead for measuring these images is not too terrible. The security comes at a price but this benchmarking is done on container startup time when the image is measured with a machine with a hardware TPM.\nAvery Blanchard: and so, as you can imagine current image digests that are provided by container repositories or dependent on image layers, manifest files, IDs and times and from the operating systems level, the only thing that we really have visibility into is this final a digest of the image itself is needed to provide the extension of a chain of trust from hardware to each container image. And so our question today is What does the path to colonel verifiable measurements of a container look like because as we can create these measurements from the operating systems level,\nAvery Blanchard: we have no way to verify against the container provider or the container Maintainer. What if these image digests that were storing and creating are correct? We would need a kernel Container digest to be provided that we could then build policy based off of\nAvery Blanchard: and so, Future work is to improve policy enforcement and connect container attestation with key lime.\nAvery Blanchard: that's most what I have for today, but I'd appreciate\nDaniel Walsh: So I got a couple of questions for you. First of all, if you looked at all at what we're doing, was composed of us.\nAvery Blanchard: no, I have not.\nDaniel Walsh: Okay, so that's something that you should investigate, so, compose a message doing sort of a dmvarity of Content put down on disk. so it's similar to what you're trying to prevent and that's what actually just Giuseppe on this call is actually working on so you should take a look at that and see if there's overlap or something you can take advantage of it and that category Other issues. I see with what you're doing is, How do you handle volumes? Because you could get random content, a Mac and Mount slash user inside of a container. And what happens then?\nAvery Blanchard: Mmm.\nAvery Blanchard: Yes, that's kind of where we need to deal with policy. We only really see the container image and so volumes are left behind in this scenario.\nDaniel Walsh: Because when you say an image too, you're talking about a root of us, right? There's all you're seeing,\u2026\nAvery Blanchard: Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: is that? The Mount Unshare, it happened and we then mounted this with us. And then you really even understand. Out the relationship between that root of fast and the original image name that was pulled down. to be right and see so you're looking for some way to track that back To some like, what? Baude man did to start that image, right?\nAvery Blanchard: Yes, we have The namespace that we can associate with the measurement versus the container running on the system, but that's the connection that we have now.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: David asked You question?\nDavid Chisnall: Yeah, Thanks Avery. That was really interesting. You might also be interested in reaching out to my former team at Azure Research. We did the initial version. What was deployed as Azure Confidential containers. So this gives you as a station over containers running in T's With.\n00:25:00\nDavid Chisnall: Rego policy to tie that into whatever your constraints are. The version I did was running an sgx enclaves, which had awful performance. The one that actually shipped it running in Snpvms, but that's actually now a deployed product. And so, I think they'd be really interested in looking at some of what you're doing and seeing if there's any intersection.\nAvery Blanchard: Great. Thank you.\nTom Sweeney: David can you send a mail to Avery? Or are you willing to hear on chat?\nDavid Chisnall: Yeah. Found your on LinkedIn. So I'll ping you there.\nAvery Blanchard: Thank you.\nDaniel Walsh: So other things that you might want to look at is Into odd, Has the concept of oci hooks. you could use the OCI hook to basically got an information about the application that's about to call on share. So I I guess it's giuseppe's a call down here at that point.\nGiuseppe Scrivano: The Cisco? Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: So basically we can call pod, We'll call a program or any of our container engines will call and Right after it establishes the container and will provide information basically the entire Mouse information to call it to the application. so if you had a hook, you could gather all the information from Pod Man that this is what is Ron, This is the command line, that's being executed, and then, that would give you information that you could even display to the user or in your logs, to say that container ID, blah, blah using image.\nDaniel Walsh: Fedora, executed this command and failed, and I'm a test because that's really what you need. So that I was so look up Oci hooks. and I think just about you run C, does it and see run. So actually this is the image specific to pod, Man R, you can do with docker, you can do with any of the container engines.\nDaniel Walsh: they use an OCR runtime hook, so that would be where you would garner in dishes or information then you could use that to have a database of what the Iowa measurements that you want to hook up to your system Reason compose a vest is interesting to us is that it would take care of the content, making sure that the content was a modified so that we pull down an image from the Internet. We want to make sure that the content to the image has not been modified after. So during the pull, we use signatures of the image that's pulled down when we write that to disk, we actually able to write stuff to\nDaniel Walsh: Compose a fest database which all goes through a similar chain of trust and we know that the file has not been modified, but we don't know. whether or not the container was run with the correct command. So you're check would be looking to say I downloaded this executable and I expected to be run with this command and Not some mash grip to something like that and so you could argue that yours was me more secure, but I think, what you really need to look at is whether or not compose of us investing would plug in together. the other thing you'd be able to tell by using an OCI hook, is whether or not there's volume is mounted. And so,\nDaniel Walsh: So if you have a volume mounted in and you rhyme that's illegal or you don't want volumes back mounted. And then you could block that execution of that container at that point.\nAvery Blanchard: Thank you. I'll look into that.\nDaniel Walsh: Yep.\nTom Sweeney: The other questions and comments, I want to wrap this up, great job, but we do have another topic or two to go.\nTom Sweeney: Right, I'm going to hand it over to Brent, then to talk about Podmann machine, ssh, keys and connection Namespacing.\n00:30:00\nBrent Baude: Thank Tom, would you mind pasting the links in there? Just for those that are following the agenda there were two Links on the agenda.\nBrent Baude: But while he's doing that that just sort of fills in some of the gaps. I think generally the core team is Purdue where this problem and there have been community members or non-core members, let's just say that have tried to submit PRS. About. Nibbling in on a fix on some of this. But the base problem statement, here is that\nBrent Baude: Podman uses when you do a machine and it kind of has all these different places. It has to go and set up. So There's SSH keys that it needs to write an SSH connections. If we just primarily, look at those three. Right now, we don't detect collision on.\nBrent Baude: Ssh are system connections until the machine is almost totally emitted. Which means it's gone through a pull It's gone through a decompression. And a disk resize before it catches it. Now Ashley just added some really good code in with callbacks that go and clean that up. After the fact, if something fails and I'm sitting on a that Check system connections before. Really any work gets done. And fails the Annette. If there's a collision. But the Ssh keys, get kind of interesting because today, We don't check, we generate a key, we use the key Gen and we give it the name of the\nBrent Baude: machine and it goes and if it fails, it gives sort of Whoops there So that's not the ideal user experience, but all these different approaches have kind of come up with. Do we need the name space? Somehow our machines either by the provider or by identifying it as a podman machine. Component. So, for example, should the key be written to something like dot ssh, slash podman machine, slash my new key. So that we don't have collisions with other keys.\nBrent Baude: Same with system, connections.\nBrent Baude: I guess theoretically, you could have a system connection with a name and have the same machine name and want to somehow keep that working together. But this idea of namespacing has been kicked back and forth for quite some time and within five. Beginning to sort of come together in terms of what we want to do. I'm wondering if we need to Go down this rabbit hole here. those two links that Tom posted then, Are sort of the feeders for this issue. So long, I'll stop talking and see what folks think.\nBrent Baude: Cool. I'll do what I want.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Do you have to put the keys in Dot SSH or can they just live in the apartment machine namespace somewhere like a key file?\nBrent Baude: Yeah, I think that's exactly it. Anders It's a matter of. Where is it? I have to look at On that intimately familiar with the options about where to write with. Ssh Keygen, but there's a way to prefix it to get where you want.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: .\nBrent Baude: and is that overly confusing to people, Are they looking for that key in that? Ssh to the care. Those kinds of ideas.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: so what we ended up doing for Lima was to generate Config So in order to do SSH, you only have to do the minus if and then you will get all the parameters for the connection including key. And the user and so on.\n00:35:00\nBrent Baude: Does that mean that all the keys are going into a singular file?\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: so it generates a key that is shared with all the VMs and that goes into a file under the lima configuration. And I think when we started it, it would also copy or existing keys from into authorized keys, on the VM. But in terms of some people have a large number of key in third of and there was also some Maybe not security, but yeah, it went from opt out to opt in at least to copy, all existing keys but that's different from where you generate the keys.\nBrent Baude: Indeed.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: But I mean, without the downside of that is that you have to do a min minus capital F or something to specify where your key is hiding. \u2026\nBrent Baude: Yep.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: mess with a key agent or something.\nBrent Baude: We do that today, anyways, because of the,\u2026\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah.\nBrent Baude: the key limit of six and\u2026\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Right.\nBrent Baude: a lot of people including me suffer with that because we have more than six keys. Good then.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: I think we also hide that in primary machine, So it's Like we can figure out where the keys are Based on the machine that you're trying to start. Yeah, so it can be hidden from the user,\u2026\nBrent Baude: Yeah. Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: I like that. I mean, I want to get to multiple machines running simultaneously. So, I think having a private primary machine, key file, somewhere we find and to me, that makes sense. All multiple.\nBrent Baude: what if folks, think of us singular key,\nDaniel Walsh: Le key for all machines. That's fine too.\nBrent Baude: That makes a lot of sense to me. Paul or\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nBrent Baude: Matt, you guys have danced around this Issues as well. Anything to add.\nBrent Baude: We do have this nice directory on all our providers, which is till they Utility config containers podman machine. So we could stick it at that. Level use the same key for all providers.\nBrent Baude: Anyone see any downside to having a singular key? Remember, it's a password list key.\nAshley Cui: The only thing is, when we remove a machine, we have to maybe add a flag that says, Remove key instead of gastruct safe keys and not remove it by default.\nDaniel Walsh: Aren't you using the same key for every machine?\nDaniel Walsh: Okay, right. Yeah. Start removing the keys.\nBrent Baude: Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: Create the key once and use it everywhere.\nBrent Baude: Okay.\nBrent Baude: So, generally supportive of this idea, it sounds like I don't think it'll actually be all that hard to implement either. And we can do we.\nDaniel Walsh: I don't see this, there's no security risk because it only goes one way. it's setting up a trust from the VM back to host. So since it's only one way, it's you just copying your public key into This is hdmen on the other end so it's not really a huge risk that I see.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: And you already mapped your home directory room.\nBrent Baude: We do allow user injection of. Go ahead, Anders.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Are you already mapped your home directory into the machine, right? So The secret out there.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nBrent Baude: Yep.\nDaniel Walsh: We probably shouldn't that directory,\u2026\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: I think it.\nDaniel Walsh:\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: it came down to a matter of difference in philosophy, between podman machine department desktop, if you will, and it's the extension of your host, should you have access to everything on your whatever MAC windows the host in the Linux VM because it's just extension or toast or is the separate entity with A Different use or in a different key So there are no rights right or wrong to that issue. But we came from different places on the machine versus desktop.\n00:40:00\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, I think most users expect their home directory to presence of the machine though.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah, unfortunately.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, I think also because that's the way things like Visual Studio and things like that, sort of make that requirement.\nBrent Baude: I'm happy.\nTom Sweeney: Did you want to touch it all up on the other topic that we had here earlier? the guest OS?\nBrent Baude: He's still on, is it David? Is that right?\nTom Sweeney: Yes.\nBrent Baude: He's David, you're still on my list. I got yanked in some prioritization exercises that Took all my gumption away from reviewing but I owe you a review. I don't think our current materials changed in the sense that we would like to see a provider for free BSD machine. But still shy away from the guest OS aspect of that. So we'll work with you on that. And I'll get that review here as I unbury myself.\nDavid Chisnall: Yeah, I made the changes that we talked about last time and\u2026\nBrent Baude:\nDavid Chisnall: I have to. Yeah. and then I hit an issue that The firmware variables file system, flag was set incorrectly, which I saw you fixed yesterday. thanks for that. So now that's fixed, I'll Do a bit more testing and see why is unhappy with me?\nBrent Baude: Okay.\nTom Sweeney: Should I put another topic in the next meeting for this as well? Just or\u2026\nBrent Baude: If you like we can do a checkpoint.\nTom Sweeney: at least a status update. I'll add that for the next one. Which before I forget, we are due to conflicts with meetings for most of the folks at Red Hat on Thursdays afternoons that have come up recently. We're going to be moving the Cabal meetings from the Thursday to the third Tuesday of each month. so the other team And so they'll still be at the same time. 11:00 AM Eastern utc5. By the time we get to the next one, which will be on November 21st, in our next community meeting where we do more demos and that kind of thing around is on December 5th, which is also to stay, which is the first Tuesday of the month. So we'll have meetings on the third Tuesday of the month, although the first one of the month is every other month on the evening months.\nTom Sweeney: and that is all that we had for the topics that were defined beforehand. Does anybody have any topics or questions? I'd like to do themselves Brent?\nBrent Baude: I'll give everyone else a chance. But if we need to Fill some time. I would love to give an early. Present everyone and maybe talk about a few pod man, five things.\nDaniel Walsh: So before we get to that, I'm going to put Urvashi on the spot here. Urvashii and I She's been working on this project along with nalin to do what we're calling Pod, Man, Fileman farm The basic idea is Allow to make it easy to build Multi Arch Images. So if you had two primary machines or two more, pardon me a connections to other machines that are running on different architectures, that you could assemble a multi action image from a container file, so you give that container file. It goes out to three different pod, man. Services somewhere in the Internet or on your local machine and\nDaniel Walsh: then creates a manifest pulls the images from those machines back to The original machine assembles an image and then allows you to assemble some manife manifest list and then you could push that manifest list and all the images up to container registry and you have a multi-atch. Build\n00:45:00\nDaniel Walsh: so Herbert she's being very quiet here, but one of the interesting things is that works very well on a Linux box. But if you run it on a Mac or a windows, where is the assemble point for, the image where you're going to create the manifest list, where you're going to pull the images to So say you're building x86 and I don't know. all the same time you want to pull all three of those images back to The primary machine and then create a manifest list. So, wherever she want to talk about where we're currently thinking,\nUrvashi Mohnani: Yeah So last that we had a discussion we were thinking of basically pulling the images from the machines or the VMs onto the primary Not one in machine, learn to the local Mac or Windows basically. So that will probably pulled in a dirt format and then we can push that to the primary machine so that I can end up in your Container Store. So then when you do a partment images from, your client you'll be able to see that manifest list and images there as well. The reason we need to I believe pull it on to the Mac directly versus because the Mac is the one that would know about the connections that we have with the other machines, that's where we store the system connection information, and the farm information and the containers.com file.\nUrvashi Mohnani: So that's what we were thinking and that's kind of something I'm testing out. I haven't completed that yet. So that's a work in progress. It's right now the local Linux work is done and the PR is about to be merged hopefully soon. I think it's in its final stages of reviews. So once that's and then the next part would be getting this working on the Mac with the remote case.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, so the primary machine in that case will be the default. But machine.\nUrvashi Mohnani: Yeah, that is yes.\nDaniel Walsh: So anybody have any thoughts on this? Is everybody thoroughly confused by what we're doing.\nValentin Rothberg: I think the VMs or the images, the individuals can be pushed from the VMs and then the manifest list be assembled locally and then pushed\nValentin Rothberg: This would prevent pulling the images around.\nUrvashi Mohnani: I think the issue there is that the primary machine wouldn't have information of the connections and the farm like that would be stored on the Mac itself. I think because that's what the containers are gone, file So that's why we were thinking, it has to come first to the Mac and then go there before, instead of us trying to figure out how to set up those connections from the primary machines, as well.\nValentin Rothberg: So, if the idea is to push the manifest list, then I think that the push can be done from each of the connections individually to the registry. Then. The MAC client knows, which images have been pushed. He knows the digests. And then on the client side, the thing that has to be done is then to create the manifest list or the OCI index. And it's pretty much just the JSON file. And I think this can be done in the Oci transport locally which works on the Mac and Windows as well.\nDaniel Walsh: so when you say on the Mac, you talking about in the machine or locally on the Mac,\nValentin Rothberg: On the client side. So even though the multi-arch images, the individual ones could be pushed directly from the VMs from the machines. Then they're on the registry\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: And then you create a manifest Yeah,\u2026\nValentin Rothberg: we have the dig.\nDaniel Walsh: you credit manifest list. Assembled with the Digest. Basically, it's just a JSON file. Locally on the back of the Windows box and then you're going to push that to the registry as well, right?\nValentin Rothberg: So once the individual images are pushed, that they're on the registry, then you can create the manifest list or the OCI index with a specific digests. Those have to be known And then you don't have to pull an images around but you can push them. Once then, assemble the JSON file, and push it to the registry.\nUrvashi Mohnani: So basically then this one exists in your local storage, You just pushing it directly to a registry.\nValentin Rothberg: yeah, container storage does not exist on the Mac, the strength,\nUrvashi Mohnani: I'm talking about the primary apartment machine that has container storage.\nValentin Rothberg: Yes, they're the image. You can push it directly to the registry. So to avoid conflicts on the tech. You can do a digest push. instead of having attack, you can specify the digest, I seamless love unmuting, maybe he has lots as\n00:50:00\nMiloslav Trmac: Each other. There's a snug in there in that you can't do a digest push without first compress in the data. And image doesn't really have a way to do that right now. you could do it if you know that I just in advance, so You don't.\nValentin Rothberg: but after building the image, the Digest,\nMiloslav Trmac: Delete attack, but it's something that probably can be built in some other way.\nUrvashi Mohnani: Go ahead, nalin.\nDaniel Walsh: He?\nNalin Dahyabhai: One thing I will worry about in that case. two things is you be sharing a credentials that you use to write to the registry with whatever your endpoints are that are doing the bill work and assuming that they can connect to the registry, you also have as most outside you would have to tag it because you can't push the digest until the digest and that may change during the Problem with trying to untagging images that I registry that's doing aggressive garbage collection will get rid of that image very quickly. Perhaps before you even have a chance to write a manifest list that references that image that you just pushed.\nValentin Rothberg: I'm not that worried about the credentials because I would assume that I have to trust the registry where I built my images on because Is where, potentially mine said My sensitive data will be, in any case, I maybe need even credentials for pulling. so, I would guess that the credentials for pushing should be okay.\nUrvashi Mohnani: Isn't that more of a requirement than from the user to get into the machines and\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: He doesn't.\nUrvashi Mohnani: get all the credentials and everything set up there before they can do these builds.\nNalin Dahyabhai: While presumably,\u2026\nValentin Rothberg: Just credentials are passed from the client side.\nNalin Dahyabhai: this is something that we\nValentin Rothberg: You don't have to set them up.\nUrvashi Mohnani: Okay.\nValentin Rothberg: Those are part of the rest API.\nTom Sweeney: Was a great discussion and I think we can go on for quite a bit more, but we've only got a couple months left in the meeting is Urvashi could you include a link to the PR that you're working on in the chat?\nDaniel Walsh: All right.\nUrvashi Mohnani: Yep.\nTom Sweeney: Go ahead and included The notes. And if folks have for the talks, we can do that there. we can add a topic to the next couple meeting if that's appropriate. And thank you all for that. And Brent, did you want to do a quickie on the 5.0?\nBrent Baude: Probably not. But what I can do is say that there will be a pod man 4-8 Coming out in. November sometime, and we have planned for, and in some cases begun to Work upon Man 5 that should theoretically come out. Very early next year. And we'll continue to share as we go along with that We intend to branch after we release for eight four, five. I'll repeat that we plan to branch podman 5 will be the main branch. After we release for eight.\nBrent Baude: I think that keeps you more on time.\nDaniel Walsh: we had talked about a fortnight for real but that'll just be like a 485 of, just bug fixes for four eight, There we'll go into actual right.\nTom Sweeney: Good.\nTom Sweeney: I just don't know whether or not would release not to start over but probably so I would think the 49 or whatever. But five of those that started.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, and there's no reason to go to 49 unless we had new features. So yeah, we had new features and we had to go before 9 but it'd be very limited features. If there is any\nTom Sweeney: Right. Any other questions comments thoughts?\nTom Sweeney: David did bring up a note. I think aimed at you She in the messages, in the chat. And I'll let you take a look at that, not just that on your own.

Today is Tuesday, January 16th, 2023. We have a pretty long list of topics this week to talk about. So we're starting off with talking about automatic Cube apply. Not sure who's running. That one. Is that matters again? Do you know?\nDaniel Walsh: I think I can lead the discussion on it. I think is everything on.\nTom Sweeney: I don't see her yet. But before we hop in that I'll just go quickly through the others. We're gonna do the Pod man support for VMS that one then and Alberto here for see her on VM and\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nTom Sweeney: Tyler be talking about and then Matt had wanted to talk about an image ID consistency with a Issue that's popped up in the podman issues. That's in the agenda. If you want to take a look at it, and then finally we'll be talking a little bit about podman V 50 schedule updates. So given all that. I'm going to talk to the primary on keep applied down run with that.\nDaniel Walsh: so I think someone has brought up the fact. There's an issue on whether or not we should be doing ube apply at all. The main problem with Kube apply as a Paul wrote War Robbie. I promise name brought this up. Very urvashi you're involved in this. we have now as part man to play POD man Coop generate and we added Prime man Coupe apply and apply basically will take the locally running cui ammo and apply it to a\nDaniel Walsh: remote or a local kubernetes instance. And so the comment that we got was they didn't believe that we should have implemented it because we didn't implement the entire Kubla and I think original thought I think whenever she and I will building this was that it sort of completes this, you build it locally you test a locally and then you push it into openshift and that's why we added it. I'll push it into kubernetes.\nDaniel Walsh: I think when we've talked about on the past, we also said you could also pull it back. And right now we don't really have the ability to pull it from a kubernetes cluster but it is a slippery slope and to implementing all cool it and a certain point. We basically want people Just use couplet for it. So the question is should we drop support for We continue on and additional features to it. Urvashi you have any comments on it?\nUrvashi Mohnani: Not really just in terms of adding additional features. I don't think we should delve more into that space because at that point, however, we separate how much of cubelet are we trying to replicate then I think initial discussions this came up when we were talking about Cube apply. And I think we said that we just want to have that, developer to kind of cluster path and would end it at this point. And after you have deployed into your cluster, then you can use Cube CDL or the web console to manage your workloads on the cluster. so yes, I don't think we should add more features. I also don't think we should remove this. It's already there. We can add documentation to clarify that this is where it ends and we're not going to add anything more really, but it's open for discussion like whatever everyone else thinks.\nDaniel Walsh: Do you think it would make sense though, just to add retrieve.\nUrvashi Mohnani: Yeah, we could do that to match the opposite behavior that shouldn't be difficult to do.\nDaniel Walsh: Anybody else have any comments?\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, I think we just throw that in the man page then, if we've handled that go back.\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, we just need the landing spot where we can point people out if this question again in the future, but I too likely the addition of the three of command if we can and then documenting it all.\nDaniel Walsh: an go Vivek\nVivek Goyal: I just have a generic question. So. The way I see I was introduced to this traditional podman Matt mode where I just run containers and pass everything on the command line. And now this thing was Parliament q and then Associated options where you can deal with kubernetes objects and different use cases to play locally and then apply to Cluster. So this is just generally question. is there any sense at what users find more interesting or the equally interesting or any sense in terms of user adoption? Apartment you versus regular apartment.\n00:05:00\nDaniel Walsh: still I think the reason we pushed for coup obviously is a Docker compose alternative because lots of people looking for mechanisms for managing multiple containers multiple Pods at the same time. And so that's how we originally Envision that makes more sense to work developers towards kubernetes than it does to basically sitting in an island compose so that was the original idea I don't know how many people are apply. Although I do know that we could bring in the Pod man desktop team to talk more about this, but I know at least they demonstrate quite a bit that this workflow. I don't know if they have data on how many times people actually take a kubernetes yaml file with the developing and pushing into\nDaniel Walsh: into a running instance of kubernetes. No.\nVivek Goyal: So it's sort of follow-up question why I'm asking this is some people are interested in sportman Cube that can we extend it to VMS as well.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah that you're jumping ahead to the next section.\nVivek Goyal: Yeah, yeah. Okay. yeah forget about it. Thank you.\nDaniel Walsh: Anybody else have any comments? So I think the output would be let's just add a poll or whatever we gonna call it and then document in the man page that this is the end of our pod man support for playing basically at this point everything else you should use Google. If you need more features than this then you need to go and get cool. But\nTom Sweeney: No, that sounds good.\nUrvashi Mohnani: Sounds good to me. Thanks.\nTom Sweeney: Urvashi, can I ask you to make sure that gets put into our backlog some more? Or thank\u2026\nUrvashi Mohnani: Yeah, I'll create a card for it.\nTom Sweeney: All right, next up. We have sea run VM Dan Walsh and Alberto febria, and I'm apologize if I messed up your last name over.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, quickly and Alberto's gonna do a demo and then we're going to talk about this and some of this it's kind of a really cool feature and I wanted expose it outside Red Hat. It isn't packaged right now although this pull requests to start the packaging process. Thanks to location. So one of the things that When Giuseppe introduce Iran, one of the interesting things is we basically added sort of a C library plug-in interface. So run would take care of processing the oci runtime spec and then we could add additional.\nDaniel Walsh: additional I run times to it. So over time now we had sea run k run which was so the first one which Elijah run a container inside of a kbm separated environment similar to iconic and do but a little later way in a little bit different and then eventually that evolved into sea run Kay run Sev, which I think Tyler's could be demonstrating which is using five minute to run confidential containers. later, we added sea run Wasim, which allows you to run wasn't workloads as\nDaniel Walsh: as a container and basically use the wasm that's from the host operating system. So you don't have to package. It was them in every single container in the universe what we use in OCR runtime for it similar to that. we had discussions internally about should we run Ciroc will we originally called raccoon the idea was to take a container or if a container that just contained a VM image. So the Q cow to our\nDaniel Walsh: a artifact that Christian contained at qat too and just run it as a VM. So the basic idea is taking VMS and running them as containers as opposed to a container and running. It is a VM. So Alberto went off and looked at this and he's about to give it demonstration of It Go, Alberto.\n00:10:00\nAlberto Faria: So hopefully screen sharing works. second\nAlberto Faria: All\u2026\nTom Sweeney: It looks good the size.\nAlberto Faria: Okay, just get right into it. So we have a VM image here. You've got two file and with the Syrian VM or Sharon time we can use Potomac actually run that so Let's talk with some time. development runs like this around VM runtime. Let's make it interactive and some more standard options and now then mentioned we can run VMS from container images that contain VM images, which is true and I'm going to show that in a second, but we can also A duality container image if we have just the image file. Like I do here we can also use the router fastpotment run flag and give it here the directory or the VM is contained the images content and currently so that butman run doesn't complain. We have to give the command, but of course we don't actually use that so I'm just passing an empty argument here.\nAlberto Faria: So a couple seconds later we should get again. There it is. I'm just gonna let it put\nAlberto Faria: It is. I can't actually log in yet because this is just a base Cloud Explorer image. So I don't know what a password is, but we're going to fix that in a second. I mentioned we can Container images right? And that's what I'm doing here. This is the exact same command. I used earlier, but now instead of put a fast I just passing the Image thanks that that's in the image that in contains a image file inside. Yeah, so we're just using container images as a sort of packaging format for VM images. And this is the same thing. Okay. so\nAlberto Faria: let's try to make this command line a bit better. I mentioned I couldn't log in yet as I don't know the password but Serenity, I'm also accepts some custom options and of course podman run doesn't understand this, but we can pass them and as what would be arguments to the image and Syrian DM will interpret those one of those is password and these lets me set password for the default user for the VM. Now this internally uses cloud in it. So the password blank will only work if the VM support in it, and there and there's a bunch of other flags as well, which I'm not going to show in the interest of time. But you can also pass in any cloud in it config to the VM. You can also pass in ignition config Etc. So now I should be able to plug in Yep with the best password. Okay, here it is.\nAlberto Faria: something cool we can do is actually exact interview. And the only work currently here is that as the first argument I have to pass in the username of the user to exact guess because behind the scenes is just sshing into VM and there we go. That's a VM. probably took enough time already. So I'm just gonna Show a last command just showing a couple more things that Simon PM can do. And that is one of those is actually mounting directories and those regular files into the VM.\nAlberto Faria: So let's Mount the current rectory which is what the director that has the VM image into the VM add some path that we can see it and also another thing we can do is as block devices any blocked device and you can pass through other things as well, but I'm just gonna show this.\nAlberto Faria: Right now it should see those here. There's a demography with the Fedora 39 directory which in turn has the VM image and we also have not here but we have the run0 device here. All right. Okay, so that's what I had shown now. So any questions or comments?\n00:15:00\nAlberto Faria: Okay. there's a\nTom Sweeney: Just a quick particular podman version on this works on starting with.\nAlberto Faria: I didn't really test that Sirens GM is just a nucy I run time. So I'd expect it to be very widely compatible with probably what mentions that are currently news.\nTom Sweeney: Are you?\nAlberto Faria: Yeah, there's not really any Department specific logic in this and by the way, this works with ruthless podman, which is what I'm using. You can also useful apartment. It's also compatible with darker and so So is there a mechanism to catch the central process? Right. So some sort of snapshot mechanism for the there's no such thing at the moment. At least. We haven't really thought about that.\nDaniel Walsh: it's potentially interesting use case because obviously we have the ability to snapshot a container right now. So, theoretically Might be something we could look into.\nDaniel Walsh: The key thing here as we do this as we don't want to change. We don't want to make this podcast so that this theoretically could be used in. other container engines and including kubernetes so theoretically cryo and continuity you could use it as well as Docker and that's why he's interpreting some options. We also don't want this thing to even if this is vasless successful, we don't want to be looking at a huge amounts of options like, basically building this into a\nDaniel Walsh: A vagrant type thing but I envisioned this as being a decent way to it's somewhat similar to kubert which is causing some controversy because I think will cause some controversy because people are asking when you use Cooper when you use this tool, but I just want to see this tool, this. I run time develop and figure out where we want to how people gonna use it and how it develops. One thing that has been talked about is potentially using ribute To further enhance it so Ryan already I think k run does this type functionality. So there might be again things that we special attributes to see right? You run M could take\nDaniel Walsh: did I say the wrong thing again? I said attributes that notations. All right. I have a brain fight on that all the time. So yeah use the annotations to customize the way the O'Shea runtime works and there is some decent precedence for that. I think Alberto also has the ability to it's using libbert underneath the covers and so you can specify we've talked about specifying lebaric XML as a way for people who are very Advanced VM uses to do it. I'm going to give a little Tyler do a quick demo of what he's got and then I want to bring back for a discussion VMS in general and some thoughts that we have around partner machine handling some of the stuff so\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, quick question to Alberto and you can do this for Tyler's going on. Do you have a link for any documents Pages project, GitHub sites or anything for this?\nAlberto Faria: Yes, there's a link to the GitHub which then you'll post it. I'm just gonna write that again. That's a guitar for the oops.\nTom Sweeney: Great.\nAlberto Faria: Okay, there's a title there.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, you cut and paste in my typo.\nAlberto Faria: Yes. So the last one is a link to that for the project.\nDaniel Walsh: There's really great read me there too. So it should help people really sort of understand how to use it.\nTom Sweeney: Thank you. Alberto's great. Fanelli my hopefullying up butchering your name as well. two in a row Tehran and\u2026\nTyler Fanelli: You got it now. That's right. Yeah. Sure,\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Putnam take it away.\nTyler Fanelli: so I have a few slides that I'd like to give I can go through them quickly. I just like to talk about what the camera is actually trying to solve and especially with respect to confidential Computing. So I'll start that's this slide real quick, but I'll go through pretty quickly as everybody able to see that. All right.\nTom Sweeney: Looks good.\nTyler Fanelli: All right then. So I'm Tyler and I'm talking about a testable confidential workloads. Podman k run and save S&P as Dan mentioned k run in this instance is a package up with Sean in the sea run runtime. So I'll just be going through what is lip Cave Run give an introduction on confidential Computing and SMP talking about attestation and showing how we kind of bring that together and giving a demo. So the first question is what is loop k run so To try to explain this think of a scenario that we have three containers On a normal container runtime and they're all running happily and so one.\n00:20:00\nTyler Fanelli: Attempts with some malicious code to escape the container I'd get some privilege escalation and get access to host OS resources. There are security measures in place, but this is still possibility with host OS resources. It could potentially look about the system With data or simply spy on other processes other containers on a system. So the imagine that scenario not good and we'd like to try to quarantine as much potentially malicious applications as much as possible. So if we think about Loop here runs architecture, it's up until the container runtime as far as anybody running containers is concerned. It's pretty much the same. We have a container context that's managed by sea presents itself\nTyler Fanelli: to The Container runtime as such but inside that sea run is a virtual machine. It's a lightweight based virtual machine that's managed by lid k run and the applications put inside that virtual machine. So if we compare the two it's As far as container run times into presented the same. It's just inside. They can't context there's a And applications running inside that virtual machine and loop 1 pretend provides the context to communicate between the two. That being the sea run runtime and the application in the virtual machine itself. So for our previous example, we have that application again, and it's running malicious code to\nTyler Fanelli: escalate the Privileges and break out the container, but it's still in a virtual machine. So this provides some process isolation for potentially malicious workloads. Right. and the question is are we fully protected at that point? these three are now running as krun VMS. And they're protected from each other. What are they fully protected? Not really because what about the host hypervisor some type of malicious acting administrator still able to appear into the containers themselves. So there's no barrier from malicious hypervisor or an administrator from reading or tampering with the memory. With this you can have the potential leaking of Secrets and sensitive workloads require a bit more protection.\nTyler Fanelli: So the question is, how can we prevent everyone even the hypervisors are self from reading the use data being the ram of the containers? For that we can use confidential Computing. It's basically a technology that isolates sensitive data in a protected Enclave. And only the guest owner of that virtual machine is able to read the contents of that memory. and it focuses on data, that's basically hot memory such as RAM and CPU rather than data at rest such as files on file system or a database something that's sitting on disk. And this is implemented using trusted execution environments.\nTyler Fanelli: And The Trusted execution environment that we're going to be focusing on today. There's some differences between every CPU manufacturers trusted execution environment technology. But today we'll be focusing on AMD set S&P and basically includes a platform secure processor that manages So the encrypted VMS running on a system with these Keys they're able to determine who can access which memory of a virtual machine all the ram of virtual machine is less encrypted and it needs that key to decrypt that memory in order to read from Ram.\nTyler Fanelli: Neither the hypervisor nor other VMS have access to this key. It's only available to the guest itself and all that management is done by the PSP. So this is done on the chip rather than unless is even hypervisor software itself cannot access these Keys. There's also some other features like data replay memory remapping and such. These are other attacks that can kind of compromise a system and this is also what said S&P looks to prevent.\n00:25:00\nTyler Fanelli: So we just see how lived here on uses of S&P. We basically measure our entire environment of the virtual machine and tell the secure processor that this is all to be encrypted. So when we're running nobody can read any of the BIOS kernel Etc everything that's going to go into our virtual machine and then we actually hide our actual application that's going to be run in that virtual machine is going to be hidden on a lux encrypted disk. And the one thing we'd like to prove is that our systems not actually lying to us and saying that we're encrypted saying that we're confidential when we're actually not so there's a one thing that needs to be done is a testing that system and basically the result of of a successful attestation is that you get the passphrase to the Lux encrypted disk\nTyler Fanelli: So basically it's talk about attestation. So we're told that our application is running confidentially on trusted Hardware, but how can we be? The one thing you have to verify is that the hardware you're running on is TE Hardware from a chip supplier from it's actually running unverified hardware and that the software That is running on that system is what you expect it to be as in they don't map some pages in that could leak Secrets itself. that map some unencrypted memory that could be used to.\nTyler Fanelli: the skirt around the confidential guarantee\nTyler Fanelli: So how lip k run does this a communicates with what's known as an attestation server? We call it here the r server. Basically that key that it's looking to get is the passage to the Lux encrypted disk. There's a five-step process of the communication between the lip care on client and the server itself. in this instance Live Care on is known as the key broker client. it's wanting to be attested. It's the guest that's looking to be attested and the server has pre-registered measurements and workload information that I can use to compare from what the client's looking for so just to recall that care runs code and application is hidden behind as luxury disk and the passphrase to unlock. This disc is stored on the So a successful attestation means that your application can run if you don't successfully attest\nTyler Fanelli: Your application will never run in that Loop k run it won't be able to unlock the disc that assignment. So we talked about how podman's role in this. It's a pod man facilitates to bring up and gives the necessary information needed for attestation. So build authors a CW flag that stores container contents inside encrypted Lux disk so does this for us builds that looks disk and then it registers the Luxe passphrase and attestation information anything that's needed to attest with the attestation server. and then it creates that container image and gives the container access to the attestation server address so it knows where to reach out to a test. so builda is the essential registration part of when we're building our container image and then we can encrypt the\nTyler Fanelli: Application behind the Luxe disc so then padmean offers obviously the sea k run runtime so runs the containers with Care on protection and then run facilitates the attestation to verify the environment and unlock the disc using the passphrase. So just a quick demonstration of build not a demonstration but a diagram of Builder basically you would use Builders of the build command and build that has a CW flag. With some of the details that's needed to register with an attestation server. So would then create that container image with the luxury Cryptid disk and then given the address the attestation server it'll register the pastries with. the information that's needed to attest.\nTyler Fanelli: when run goes to a test, then it'll give its attestation evidence and the isolation server will examine that evidence and with the information previously registered it'll either successfully attest and give back that passphrase. So the k run virtual machine can start running or it'll say the attestation failed and there's no looks passphrase you haven't successfully attested so you can't run your application yet. So it's just basically ver Thing that you're actually running confidentially. If so, then it's unlocking your disc and you're going to be able to run so at that point the attestations complete and then through the set S&P encryption live camera now protects your processes from potentially malicious hypervisors, and it allows users to run their process without worrying about potential spying or tampering.\n00:30:00\nTyler Fanelli: I can give a quick demo at the moment.\nTyler Fanelli: And it went on to share a woman's up.\nTyler Fanelli: first a quick demo Of how we're going to be using it. So on the right here, we have an\nTyler Fanelli: on the right here. We haven't had a station server running. It's known as reference KBS I can link. To that itself, but it's an attitude server running that's going to receive things from build and test it with Karen.\nTyler Fanelli: So at the moment we have this if you see in the top left here, basically the application that we're going to run is just a simple web server that you're going to reach out and it'll tell you a secret. So if you see the secret right here, I originally gave this presentation for the virtualization team. So the secret is vert team. see that that was stored in static memory. So as part of the memory of the guest you should be able to read that from another process on the system and we'll see what I'm talking about the moment. So we're just starting up a\nTyler Fanelli: A regular web server. It's not confidential at this point. So. There's nothing special going on here. We're just running this web server in a container.\nTyler Fanelli: everyone\nTyler Fanelli: we'll run that on poor 8080 so we see the application started. It's just a normal container at the moment. If we go to reach out to that server.\nTyler Fanelli: We can see that the serversaver to return with the secret is verse team. there's nothing surprising there. It's able to read its memory and go back to it. Then we'll dump the contents of that process that's running that web server. And we'll try to read that secret that stored in static memory. So we'll see the process ID and then we'll dump the product the contents of the memory of that process.\nTyler Fanelli: Then we'll search for that secret that we just read from the web server will search that secret in the processes memory.\nTyler Fanelli: And we're able to see So nothing special It's stored in static memory and we're able to read it. Let's run it confidentially. And see if we're still able to read that secret. from another process on the same host So if we go through there's no. Deleted the can container. So I'm running this If you see on the top left, basically this was done before we had the Builder support So in this example, it's using oci 2cw. But everything that I'm showing right now is actually able to be done in Builder instead. And so this is a bit outdated at the moment. So we have a configuration file. This is what's going to be given to the k run guests. So when the k run guests eventually loads the\nTyler Fanelli: The initial code that's going to be running is going to be able to read some of this information. This is all the attestation information that it needs to reach out. So if you see the URL there that's the attestation server running to the right side of the screen. I mean\nTyler Fanelli: So what we're going to do we're building would be doing this at this point is we're going to build that container image confidentially. And register the contents with the attestation server, which you'll see them. One moment.\nTyler Fanelli: So you see there's been a workload ID and some adaptation information such as the passphrase that's going to be used to unlock the disk and information used to attested. It's going to require we can then run with the k run runtime\nTyler Fanelli: where we'll then reach out to the statistic server again in a test.\nTyler Fanelli: So obviously we've mounted the Rocks the Lux root file system. And if you see on the right here, there's just some information showing that we successfully attested we at a station is a multi-step process with validating certain certificates with an attestation report comparing launch measurements, which is the contents of your software checking some hashes Etc. But if you see the k run virtual machine has done all of that and then the bottom left here what we'll try to do again. We're for the bottom left here. We're going to try to see if we're actually confidential. So we'll read what we're going to do is reach out to the server again.\n00:35:00\nTyler Fanelli: And we see that the server running in that virtual machine is able to run is able to view its memory contents. So that will now are going to try to dump the contents of that virtual machine and read that secret again, we were able to do that with non-confidential. a container running But if we try to read the memory now.\nTyler Fanelli: And then we'll grip for that secret again. from another process\nTyler Fanelli: And we're not able to find it. That's because that secret is now encrypted. So it's not just in plain text over the process.\nTyler Fanelli: So that is the podman demo, so I went a little faster, which usually\nTyler Fanelli: the faster even one second. Next steps that we're thinking for podman in k run his arm CCA support. It's the confidential Computing architecture from arm and it's useful for Edge scenarios that we could see and then how we also looking at build a support for other at a station servers such as there are some known as key broker. Cocoa more mature implementations of KBS attestation servers. So there's any questions?\nDaniel Walsh: It alright. I just want to put point out that podman build has the same support the Builder has so obviously it's sucking in Builder. So all that all is available other things you should know is that unlike the previous demo where?\nTyler Fanelli: Okay, yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: But I guess theoretically this would work but you could when we're not allowed to SSH so pod man exact into confidence or container by default does not work and I think that's sort of expected. The whole idea here is that we don't trust any process on the host operating system and\u2026\nTyler Fanelli: That's right.\nDaniel Walsh: confidential workload so that even the admin someone running full route full capabilities is not able to See the system, the he can do is denial of service that he can kill it. That's about it. Go Vivek.\nVivek Goyal: So I have two questions. First question is you generated this disk image. This is local. So the very fact you are protecting against hypervisor. I'm assuming you will generate the disk image on some sub separate build server and host them somewhere in some sort of registry, right? So it has been figured out that\u2026\nTyler Fanelli: Yes.\nVivek Goyal: how will you host these images and registry?\nTyler Fanelli: That's also what we're still looking at because obviously like you said that's being generated on that same host. So it doesn't make sense at the moment. There's still ways for you to violate that Integrity. But yeah, so we'll still need to be some way that lux encryption is already done beforehand on the host. As to not leak any access of Secrets because at the same time build that at that point is creating the secret so it can just store it somewhere at that point. even if it goes through\nVivek Goyal: right\nTyler Fanelli: Even if it does, does create it looks encrypted. It has access to the passphrase.\nVivek Goyal: Yeah. \u2026\nDaniel Walsh: but the idea is that we push the Encrypted image to an oci registry and\u2026\nVivek Goyal: So here's my sorry.\nDaniel Walsh: then the tooling should be able to pull the encrypted image down and it'll pull it\u2026\nTyler Fanelli: right\nDaniel Walsh: but So it's not decrypted until it gets a secret and I believe now in nalin did most of the work on the part the probably bill. I don't think er. Reveals to the user running podman Bill what the secret is. So the secret actually is exchanged. I mean, obviously if you estrace and you could see it but the secrets exchange with the attestation server directly and it's not even human control. That's just a random secret that's generated. now and\nNalin Dahyabhai: No, you're correct. But you can specify Pathways. But if you don't we just generate one of them throw it away after it's registered.\n00:40:00\nVivek Goyal: So here is the follow-up question after that. So with this assumption that there's a crypted disk. You'll have to host and registry somewhere. And I think this is where it overlaps for the seed and VM stuff. That the only difference I see here is if I understand correctly. You don't have the kernel and rest of the operating system you have it. Outside somewhere the custom one your kernel and internet FS. All you have done is in a disc loaded the actual workload you want to run?\nVivek Goyal: And then while you're presenting I will just comparing these two models that in the confidential VM use case. We are let's say using boot C or whatever we pack the actual kerneline interim fs. And that will allow me to do the easy upgrades later without resealing things and talking to the registration server, but let me not go there yet. So I wanted to hear your thoughts. I feel that technically at some point of time. We are not there yet that it should be the same thing. Should we doable with the serum VM as well and using the confidential VMS the bill those disk images push it to some registry goate attestations are unlocks it you boot the kernel which is content says inside the desk and not the your custom kernel. And I was just thinking that what are the advantage and disadvantages of these two current waste approach? Probably the one thing is probably lightweight you probably are going to boot faster because you have done some customization you can take some shortcuts. apart from that Can you think of other advantages?\nDaniel Walsh: The fun and fundamentally one's running container. The bodman k run one is running containers and BOD Man sea run PM is running VMS. so theoretically we could run a VM inside of a container in a confidential mode, but right now what he was demonstrating is running a container inside of a confidential environment.\nVivek Goyal: from users perspective but go ahead and\nNalin Dahyabhai: It's a micro VM but it looks like a container the main difference is if you're booting with a kernel and an IT Rd that's part of the shared library, then the disk is still encrypted and it's not visible to the host at all because the internet Rd is the bit that's contacting the server and then decrypts the disk in the VM. Whereas if you wanted to boot just the disk you'd have to decrypt it first which means the content that this would be exposed to The Host.\nVivek Goyal: So in case of confidential VM, what people are doing that using the similar things like at least the proposal is the root disk is still be encrypted and then the decryption key will be tied to the vtpm and it's actually the vtpm secrets which you'll get some from the attestation server. So what I'm trying there are many flavors to it and even there are three four flavors. So I think that this flavor can change a little bit that's perfectly fine. But ultimately in my mind it boils down to that how a certain approaches more lightweight or heavy weight and we necessarily don't have a good answer but I'm just sort of like Brainstorming a bit, I will see that. How does it evolve?\nDaniel Walsh: yeah, I think there's a potential for allowing us to run a VM inside of a confidential workflow I mean, but that's sort of leading towards a kubert type environment where you'd basically have embedded in the container image the ability to run a VM\nVivek Goyal: I would say both what is managing it, then it's qubit environment. But if it's without keyword and warmed in Standalone as devices or anything where people using\nDaniel Walsh: but what I'm saying is we wouldn't trust the sea run qmu that's installed on the Post so the sea around here was trusting this Iran the sea run VM is trusting the cui qmu that's installed on the host. In this case. We're trusting in this case. We're trusting nothing or trusting the k run command,\u2026\nVivek Goyal: So you have to trust that right in confidential we have model that we are not building trust into the key on you.\nDaniel Walsh: but the cable unit commandant Commission.\nVivek Goyal: That's interested entity if I understand correctly.\nDaniel Walsh: No, no, it's trusted in that the measurements have to be done. So we're measuring k run. So the attestation has managed is measuring everything Through the running of the lab k run.\nVivek Goyal: Yeah, so in confidential VM what I'm trying to say, you don't rely on the trust from the Kiyomi you rely from where you are loading and how many companies you're measuring we can have this debate some of the time like,\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah. Yeah.\nVivek Goyal: there are many components to it.\nDaniel Walsh: I think we're gonna run out of time. So\nVivek Goyal: I don't know. Yeah exactly so we can have this limit.\nTom Sweeney: That's a good question. I hate to stop it, but that's more topics than just about 10 minutes left.\nDaniel Walsh: yeah, I just quickly so obviously one of the things that's happening here is where we're looking at different types of things that we can do with virtualization stack and in addition to the OCA run times and that's really what this discussion about one of the things going forward. We might want to look at is and we were out of time for this maybe in the next cabal meaning we talk about it more is everything we've showed right now is Linux Centric and Tom obviously most users of pod man going forward are going to be on Max and windows. So one of the things that we've been talking about internally is potentially expanding the use of primary machine to allow us to Launch.\n00:45:00\nDaniel Walsh: VMS potentially generated via pod man containers natively for the particular host that you're on right now if we generated a VM on a Mac is a rare image. How would you run it if we generated a type of V image on I Windows Live from how would you run and what we're looking at is can we get support for launching VMS natively on different platforms? we'll see around here. So those are things that we're talking about but as well totally run out of time for the subject and I know we have someone else so I'm gonna give up anymore.\nTom Sweeney: Thank If you could send me your slides at some point and if you have any project links for GitHub or anything mention for that to the notes, that'd be great. next up.\nTyler Fanelli: although\nTom Sweeney: Thank you. We have image ID consistency. I think Matt this is your topic.\nMatt Heon: But I think we can actually skip this one this time. I've been looking into it. this was going on. I think it's more investig.\nTom Sweeney: If anybody's interested, I'll leave it in the notes. We have some discussion going on in an issue on GitHub and podman Some feel free to dive into that then we'll segue right into part man v5.0 which I know Dan have been taking tickling about Matt. You were going to talk about it believe.\nMatt Heon: Us sure so podman 5 people probably noticed that we switched the main branch of podman over to 50 Dev. I think it was during December and we've been working on things since then 50 was going to be a breaking change release. We have a bunch of changes scheduled for it. And just to go into some details on scheduling we're expecting to start cutting release candidates in call it late January early February. It will definitely be out by the first what do they call it Fedora RC?\nMatt Heon: Or Fedora beta whatever there's a fedora deadline in early February that we're going to meet and ideally we are going to be completely done by call it late February for podman 50 final but that is not completely certain yet. There's a lot of work going on the podman machine side of things that we're going to wait for that to be done. Even if it takes a while. So we're expecting this to be an extended release period probably a lot of release candidates and the Linux side of things should be fairly stable early on we're expecting a lot of our seas on pot and machine and desktop stuff.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, and the biggest change in partner machine is that we'll be moving to the Apple hypervisor.\nMatt Heon: Yeah, there are a bunch of big under the hood changes to machine, but we are going to be defaulting to Apple hypervisor completely removing support for the qemu driver on Apple. And yeah, that's basically a maintenance thing for us. Apple HV is maintained a lot easier to work with and it offers some other advantages like faster files here.\nMatt Heon: Okay, and the questions on that are?\nTom Sweeney: Okay, we'll give them that then we are open for discussions of any sort the same if I have any questions or comments that they want to make.\nTom Sweeney: Good.\nVivek Goyal: So just because I have time the question I had asked initially and I think I had jumped the gun at that point of time. are there any thoughts of extending permanent Q to handle VMS as well?\nVivek Goyal: This is a little different from Portman machine. So that will be a separate thing permanent machine is not going to use containers. It will not deal with the kubernetes objects and everything. So it will be separate flavors submit machine of course will be there and that development to be able to move VMS.\n00:50:00\nVivek Goyal: this is something you boot the VMS in containers something like what's here and VM is doing but what you deal is you deal with the Google. It is objects The Way Apartment you've seems to be I don't know much about it yesterday. I looked at the apartment you man basis, so, please correct me if I am completely misunderstanding things.\nDaniel Walsh: So Bob and coobe should just use standard cool yaml is but sometimes people use. I'm gonna get it right this time annotations to customize the way kubernetes handles different workloads. Does anybody know if kubernetes supports annotations to change the OCR runtime?\nDaniel Walsh: because that would be the way we would have to because you're really asking that I want to run a container inside of a pod that actually happens to be a VM.\nVivek Goyal: Yeah, something like which keyword is already doing so if I understand correctly I Define a VM.\nDaniel Walsh: At Cooper it's not doing that Cooper is running a container that contains software to run a VM.\nAlberto Faria: The answer is You can change the OCR runtime for a skip the name of the different runtime which has to be installed on the\nDaniel Walsh: Okay, so that would be so if we're gonna support this that's the way we would because It's a standard kubernetes procedure. So if we should support the ability to swap out the run time based on the kubernetes yaml file.\nDaniel Walsh: So that would be the way to do it. I want to think when the cool things I think of run cute run VM is that it actually run the ATMs via quadlet and have full management of VM. This is if they were, same way we're gonna manage containers, but if kubernetes Hammer can do this, too. That's it. Seems like a nice feature.\nDaniel Walsh: I have no idea for currently works, but probably went out that far away from it should be fairly easy to make it work just to swap out the runtime if cooby animal supports it. What do you think urvashi she disappeared?\nDaniel Walsh: She's gone. Yeah.\nTom Sweeney: I think she's left.\nTom Sweeney: Right any other topics or questions?\nDaniel Walsh: Though Anders is asking about part my machine.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: I mean would you leave the qmu code for non-max or\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: was Yeah. Yes. So the answer to that is yes.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: would you just remove?\nDaniel Walsh: The problem is not with qmue of the problem is the problem we've had on a Mac is more humus support for a Mac And secondarily has been through in that people change you very recently over the holiday break.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Okay, yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: You release something that lowest totally out of the water and\u2026\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah, the firmware Instagram. Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: there's no control over when these things happen and I don't really think the Upstream Community is that much about how they work on max?\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: And neither just the Brew how they test their qmue versions.\nDaniel Walsh: Right and I think that's a problem too. And finally everyone else that we know of that started using qmu on a Mac is eventually switched to the Apple hypervisor. So Docker is Switched. I'm CRC or open shift local and I switched and\u2026\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: No.\nDaniel Walsh: with our instability on a Mac. It's just seems like okay, let's just switch.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: And now I think it's more important ability. if it was to stick around, but that's not going to be the default Target anyways.\nDaniel Walsh: Right.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: It's like the qmu is the new virtualbox. portability\nDaniel Walsh: right\nTom Sweeney: Freddy\nDaniel Walsh: any other questions?\nTom Sweeney: cut everybody here. I'll just put a couple plugs for upcoming meetings. We have our next community meeting on Tuesday, February 6. We have a podman at home demonstration by John Masters scheduled and looking for more topics for that one. And then for the ball meeting that the next be happening on Tuesday February 20th, which is two weeks after the community meeting and I've put in at the moment anyway to handle VMS from Vivek of chat here today fanelli says any other topics I'd like to discuss and that or any other one or in the community meeting. Please let me know. And going to go to Tyler.\nTyler Fanelli: I just have to say I sent you the slides and I'm going to send some other information about k run on Slack.\n00:55:00\nTom Sweeney: Awesome. Thank you.\nDaniel Walsh: I got asked My number one question that he knows is coming. When can I get cheap Hardware to try this stuff out? Keep me less than a thousand bucks.\nTyler Fanelli: that's what we're Looking that's the idea when I mentioned with arm as we discussed that we arm would hopefully be able to apply to bearing up Confidential virtual machines on cheap Hardware right now the example. I just showed on seven S&P. And also if you take it further to Intel TDX, those are not cheap Hardware they run on big cloud machines that are expensive. So that's the main motivation for doing CCA is that we can run on arm Hardware which will be cheaper.\nDaniel Walsh:\nTyler Fanelli: When is that? I'm starting to actually ramp up working on that implementation now so I don't have a set time frame but I can keep up with you on that where we are working on it.\nDaniel Walsh: Great, so I just want to get up my high horse real quick and say that I believe the confidence Computing. This is critical for Edge Computing. So any computer that can be touched by a human being that's an untrusted human being should be running in a confidential workload type environment and in the cloud, I believe it's more of a play for the cloud vendors to make more money. So it's like you want to ride confidential mode? Because basically what you're saying is when you run an Amazon Google or Microsoft, you don't trust their admins to do the right thing. there is some security stuff that Tyler talked about earlier. But again Edge deployments. This is where I think this thing really should take off, but that means cheap Hardware\nTom Sweeney: Right with that unless there's any real quick questions comments. I'm going to wrap us up for today. Thank you everybody for inventing it especially the folks that were presenting and talking today. And you quick last thoughts before I hang up on the recording. All right. Thanks everybody.\nMeeting ended after 00:57:12 \n")))}_i.isMDXComponent=!0;const Xi={},$i="Podman Community Meeting Notes",es=[{value:"February 6, 2024 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-5)",id:"february-6-2024-1100-am-eastern-utc-5",level:2},{value:"Attendees ( total)",id:"attendees--total",level:3},{value:"Topics",id:"topics",level:3},{value:"Meeting Start: 11:02 a.m. EST",id:"meeting-start-1102-am-est",level:2},{value:"Video Recording",id:"video-recording",level:3},{value:"Podman at Home",id:"podman-at-home",level:2},{value:"Jon Masters",id:"jon-masters",level:3},{value:"(1:10 in the video)",id:"110-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Podman <code>build farm</code> demo",id:"podman-build-farm-demo",level:2},{value:"Urvashi Mohnani",id:"urvashi-mohnani",level:3},{value:"(14:59 in the video)",id:"1459-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Demo - (16:56 in the video)",id:"demo---1656-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Apple Hypervisor",id:"apple-hypervisor",level:2},{value:"Brent Baude",id:"brent-baude",level:3},{value:"(28:25 in the video)",id:"2825-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Podman 5.0 Changes",id:"podman-50-changes",level:2},{value:"Matt Heon",id:"matt-heon",level:3},{value:"(45:10 in the video)",id:"4510-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Open Forum/Questions?",id:"open-forumquestions",level:2},{value:"Topics for Next Meeting",id:"topics-for-next-meeting",level:2},{value:"Next Meeting: Tuesday, April 2, 2024, 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-4)",id:"next-meeting-tuesday-april-2-2024-1100-am-eastern-utc-4",level:2},{value:"Next Cabal Meeting: Tuesday, February 20, 2024, 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-5)",id:"next-cabal-meeting-tuesday-february-20-2024-1100-am-eastern-utc-5",level:2},{value:"Meeting End: 11:58 p.m. Eastern (UTC-5)",id:"meeting-end-1158-pm-eastern-utc-5",level:3},{value:"Google Meet Chat copy/paste:",id:"google-meet-chat-copypaste",level:2},{value:"Raw Google Meet Transcription",id:"raw-google-meet-transcription",level:2}],ts={toc:es},ns="wrapper";function as(e){let{components:t,...n}=e;return(0,Ne.kt)(ns,(0,ce.Z)({},ts,n,{components:t,mdxType:"MDXLayout"}),(0,Ne.kt)("h1",{id:"podman-community-meeting-notes"},"Podman Community Meeting Notes"),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"february-6-2024-1100-am-eastern-utc-5"},"February 6, 2024 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-5)"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"attendees--total"},"Attendees ( total)"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Anders F Bj\xf6rklund, Ashley Cui, Brent Baude, Christopher Evich, Daniel Walsh, Ed Santiago Munoz, Giuseppe Scrivano, Jake Correnti, Jhon Honce, Jon Masters, Lokesh Mandvekar, Mario Loriedo, Matt Heon, Miloslav Trmac, Mohan Boddu, Nalin Dahyabhai, Neil Smith, Paul Holzinger, Thiago Mendes, Tim deBoer, Tom Sweeney, Urvashi Mohnani, Vivek Goyal, Zeh Ninguem"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"topics"},"Topics"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null," 1) Podman at Home - Jon Masters\n2) Podman ",(0,Ne.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"build farm")," demo - Urvashi Mohnani\n3) Apple Hypervisor - Brent Baude\n4) Podman 5.0 changes - Matt Heon"),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"meeting-start-1102-am-est"},"Meeting Start: 11:02 a.m. EST"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"video-recording"},"Video ",(0,Ne.kt)("a",{parentName:"h3",href:"https://youtu.be/soxBbexH_VA"},"Recording")),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"podman-at-home"},"Podman at Home"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"jon-masters"},"Jon Masters"),(0,Ne.kt)("h4",{id:"110-in-the-video"},"(1:10 in the video)"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Working with Podman for his home automation.

Normal humans doing it could fail some more comfortable with it. And we want to get it eventually into modern desktop so that it would support Farm building. So it becomes right from the goalies and a container file and\u2026\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: but\nDaniel Walsh: you want to click these three arches and it goes out and figures out how to build those reactions.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: As far as they know you would also have to add connections Department desktop, so that could be a prerequisite.\n00:25:00\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, but they said if most people that building multi ads right now attempting to do with you use the static which is if you have anything really complex can really be bad performance solo better on a Mac. So here we're looking at how could we support this in Native building? As long as you have VMS access to physical machines that are different architectures.\nTom Sweeney: I just had a couple hopefully quick questions Paul's been answering some of it. what about Farm login? Do you have to log in from each machine before you start running this or is that happening under the covers the farm?\nUrvashi Mohnani: No, you don't have to log into each machine. Once you have set up the appointment socket on your farm machines and you just do apartment system connection ad that adds the connection logic that's needed and farm just piggybacks on that. So there's no need to log in anywhere. You will have to log into your registry.\nTom Sweeney: Okay, great.\nUrvashi Mohnani: If you want to store credentials, you're just a Portman login for the registry. And then the farm bill command is able to read your auth file and send that over basically.\nTom Sweeney: So great. Let's say something steps and any other preconfig steps that people have to worry about.\nUrvashi Mohnani: Not just setting up the socket on your machines and then doing quadman system connection add to connect to that.\nDaniel Walsh: if I wanted to do A build where I did one of the Arches and emulation mode and then a different one. So I don't know has three ninety, I wanted to do that and found but I wanted to do x86 and both of my Mac. from a single machine Can I do that?\nUrvashi Mohnani: What do you mean from a single machine?\nDaniel Walsh: So we're identifying the connections based on Arch. Is that correct?\nUrvashi Mohnani: No, we're not based on Arch. So it's when you want to add a connection, right and you create the farm it goes and just Builds on all the machines there. If you have a machine in the form that has the same architecture like two machines and it will build on the first machine. It finds of that architecture.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, if I have a machine that can build me an x86 and an arm and I have another machine that is s390 and\u2026\nUrvashi Mohnani: Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: I want to build for all three hatches, but the one locally Has to do it in emulation mode. Is that possible\u2026\nUrvashi Mohnani: so It is so right now.\nDaniel Walsh: if I'm right now?\nUrvashi Mohnani: I think we're just working using the native architecture. There is good in there to determine the emulated architecture, but we haven't tested that part yet, so it's not completely done. But if that's something we want available as well, then we can test that and ensure it's working. Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah. I mean, I guess right now if you do just an appointment build with two arches on a single connection It will attempt to the emulation anyways. but\nUrvashi Mohnani: Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: good.\nTom Sweeney: Any other questions? for one Right. Thanks. Great.\nTom Sweeney: You're up with apple hypervisor updates or demos. I'm not sure which. Yeah, okay.\nBrent Baude: me either All right. I got a little shindling. I can run through here and I'm going to purse the demo Gods by doing it live. So let's start with the end product. I think that. Tells an interesting story. It will begin sharing here.\nBrent Baude: Some folks see that.\nDaniel Walsh: right\nTom Sweeney: We can it just popped up.\nBrent Baude: This is the end product. So after this we've been doing a lot of refactoring for podmin 5 and it's pretty intrusive for machine and this particular PR comes from a teammate of ours Chris. And essentially it's saying we need our apple and Mac CI to pass before a new PR can go in and this is the enforcement that says it must pass as opposed to hey, we're on it, but whatever.\nBrent Baude: The point being here. This is the big celebratory piece. Which is that the refactoring has allowed us to get the machine tests on Mac pass. So this is the big deal and one of the big benefits of our refactoring work\n00:30:00\nBrent Baude: so if we go and look at what the refactor actually kind of looks and behaves like\nBrent Baude: I'll ask the jail wise how I'm doing here?\nTom Sweeney: She could bump it up. At least one that probably be good.\nBrent Baude: was one\nBrent Baude: better\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, that's better for me anyway.\nBrent Baude: all right, so let's just clear this off and I want to show that I'm in.\nBrent Baude: I'm using code that's at least checked in are committed rather and I'm on a detached Branch from the Upstream machine to five. So this is a Proof of Life and I've already made on the make of the binary So it's got podman there and I've got it sort of linked there. and when I call Paul man, it's calling the branched one All right.\nBrent Baude: So for Apple it always starts. For all of them and always starts like this.\nBrent Baude: And I have removed the cash and everything that will make it go fast on this one because I kind of want to talk through it. So the first thing I want to point out for those that haven't been closely watching as you'll see that it's quite as opposed to pulling from the Fedora chorus distribution server using http. And that will be how things work in the future right now as far as exactly what that looks like. We're still ironing that out. This is sort of some trickery going on at present. But you saw that the pull occurred. And we went out to Kuwait to get it.\nBrent Baude: It's not as impressive because right now it's using the version which is podman 5 to Determine which version of Paul? so that doesn't really stick out but it's you doing in comparison on the version and pulling just that.\nBrent Baude: All right, and now I'll further. First Myself by not running. That's what debug.\nBrent Baude: And this will take I don't know 30 seconds or so. I'm not mean while I can kind of talk about what's going on. So right now it's actually used a ton of common code between all the providers Q mu hyper-v wso. an apple it's using common code to set up almost everything but the final call to actually the machine itself. And then as far as what happens when it's successful, it looks exactly the same. at this point so that was just a little start.\nBrent Baude: I take a peek. It looks like it's running.\nBrent Baude: and we can pop into it yet or\nBrent Baude: We can. Do some things One thing I want to point out is that\nBrent Baude: we do on Apple use virtofs. So we have a reasonably fast. sharing mechanism and\nBrent Baude: this could be an interesting example here. I want to show some differences. the\nBrent Baude: old configuration file for Apple machines look something like this.\nBrent Baude: and the new looks something like\nBrent Baude: something like that. It's maybe difficult to tell in this sort of environment, but it's considerably smaller. There's a lot less detail in here. Most of it is now abstracted. And this is the key part. This is all common now. There's a bug Ashley.\n00:35:00\nBrent Baude: That's all common, which is nice because now we have a common set apis to work with but this is where it differs and so this is just the specific stuff you see for Apple if we were doing Q mu and the Apple hypervisor stuff wouldn't be here. It would be strictly. Cameo stuff worth repeating but our will be deprecating qmu For Max so Apple hypervisor will be your only future option.\nBrent Baude: Okay, and\nBrent Baude: just another sort of proof of life here since it's something I actually run reasonably frequently on my Mac when I'm doing development is I'm pulling the golang the docker going container image and I am using amount. to mount this repository inside\nBrent Baude: and so if you look here We're in the Repository. We've got good speed for things and one of the things we like to do is something like make validate\nBrent Baude: To see that our code is passing linters. I won't subject everyone to watching this because it does take quite a bit of time, but it seems to work quite nicely.\nBrent Baude: and of course everything else is as you would expect.\nBrent Baude: Business as usual which is what we're hoping for. before I dump the terminal any questions\nTom Sweeney: We had one from Anders earlier leaves asking what you need a special image for Apple height HP when compared to Q. He and you and I cannot speak that say that.\nBrent Baude: What are you getting that honors?\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Why is it not the same OS image? Why do you need different OS images for different type of Rights?\nBrent Baude: There's two reasons one. Is that the apple hypervisor does not. honor the cute cow image\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: right So you have to convert the format?\nBrent Baude: And I really don't want to do that on users machines\u2026\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah, okay.\nBrent Baude: because I think that adds a level of difficulty the second thing. However, is that humu and Apple? implementations differ enough then it makes sense. one example is that we besock Communications instead of the Native cumia Communications for Network So we need a binary or two that are inside.\nBrent Baude: The Restless stuff we could largely adapt in the sense that it's all just ignition but that's primarily why.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: I was just wondering it's a different decision.\nBrent Baude: Yeah, one of the big hurdles Anders and all in all honesty here was the fact that using a raw image really\nBrent Baude: Really sort of stinks because it just doesn't out of the box support sparse operations. so when you make a hundred gig disc like we do when that kind of stuff happens certain operations can take this Parsons away from that disc, and now you're dealing with a massive binary blob.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah, I mean that we are doing it for Lima but I think so. the first attempt was using qmu image the program to do a great image, but obviously that's not a good idea. If you haven't installed qmu the wrote some kind of program to create the image now, but I haven't really used it myself. I think it kind of this Partners, but I can look that up. So it converts the qawi image into raw image. With the downsides that you are implying to you you also lose today so far for the Cure image you have the actual cow.\n00:40:00\nBrent Baude: Yeah.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: An aspect so you can have a base statistic and then your layers on top of that and that layering is not present in the Raw images. That means they end up duplicating that always disc\u2026\nBrent Baude: IND\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: if you have a lot of VMS.\nBrent Baude: right I am contemplating some apfs trickery. For CI to make things even faster, which would make copy on rights, potentially. the only thing being written but\nBrent Baude: But for now, I'm satisfied that it's running.\nDaniel Walsh: Hey.\nTom Sweeney: If you've garnered any kind of performance games Apple hyperview versus cumulus.\nBrent Baude: The big thing is amounts are.\nBrent Baude: That's the big thing.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: have you compared it with the virtue I or FS on qmu, or Maybe you're not doing it.\nBrent Baude: We all in large. You can look at part.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: So yeah, I'm not sure it works much.\nBrent Baude: My understanding is that. the c** you still doesn't have The one nice thing about VF kit and the way it designed and we contributed to it is that since it's running the VM technically. It holds the very fast demon if you will open and allows that connection to work. My understanding is that's not quite there in qmu. I may be mistaken, but that's what my reading leads me to believe and\u2026\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: I\nBrent Baude: that's why we're still nine p\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: It's very manual CMU still bundles the old but I fft so you have to deploy the new one the rust demon yourself and then you can connect to it, but I'm not sure the max support is there so probably only support Linux and not Darwin.\nVivek Goyal: Yeah, I think Max support is not there yet later than run as the sheer memory solution is not there.\nBrent Baude: Correct.\nVivek Goyal: So that's one thing. Some of the people are looking at that how to make what ifsd work on Mac as a separate process. so I think your character understanding that as of now what iifesty will not work on Mac the way we have implemented in as a separate process in\nBrent Baude: And we as a team and code maintainers would really love Very fast the work done windows. but nope, so we have kind of this since we're already have a deviation we might as well just deal with it. So Kim you still uses If someone says hey We really wished. here's a use case that we use it on Linux and we really need to move it over to boroughfs we would get that on the list, but\nBrent Baude: The bigger priority for us for pod Man 5 was the refactoring to the singular configuration file. and sort of making\nBrent Baude: Dead ends of our mistakes in the past and getting those out.\nDaniel Walsh: I think No,\u2026\nVivek Goyal: stop\nBrent Baude: Daniel look like you want to ask a question.\nDaniel Walsh: I don't want to ask a question. I just want to state that Q mu is not been a great experience for us from a stability point of view either and\u2026\nBrent Baude: on max\nDaniel Walsh: probably on Max and the reason for that is mainly that we didn't have control over when the thing is released and Upstream didn't seem to really care that much about the quality of the releases on a Mac. And so getting to the point where we sort of maintain the vmn outside of being updated the air. Brew is going to be hopefully very nice for us from the stability point of view.\nBrent Baude: once they get over the shock that we took it away.\nBrent Baude: other questions\nBrent Baude: So I think just in general a message, I would send to the community if they were asking me there are some new things going on. There's a lot of the changes that we couldn't make without breaking API or breaking Music Experience. I've been made. But as far as huge technical leaps in podman 5, that's not a thing. You're more likely to feature-driven Development begin after five all goes out and stabilizes\n00:45:00\nTom Sweeney: Okay, I'm going to wrap this up since we're getting close to the end. We have one more topic get to go and turn it over to Matt talking about Bobby m5o changes.\nMatt Heon: This is largely going to be a follow-on from what Brent was already talking about 50 is very much a breaking change release and that we've had a bunch of stuff over the last two years where we haven't been able to fix it because it would be a breaking change to API or be a great change to the command line output a small things like better Docker compatibility for man stats pod, man and specs other things like what do you call it? A big deprecations are coming. C groups one is being deprecated. We're not removing the code. We thought we might be but we're not completely removing it but groups who will probably be gone in six. It's deprecated in five. The old multi-b database will still work if you have an existing one, but we're restricting creation of new ones. So this is very much a\nMatt Heon: stability release in the sense that we are addressing a lot of old Tech debt and not a feature release so don't expect that much the way a new features now as for schedule, we were just discussing the hour for this and we're hoping to get a release candidate one out either later today or probably tomorrow morning. This is very much going to be an early preview and I'm expecting a long release candidate face for this release a lot of the work we're doing especially the refactoring that Brent has been doing\nMatt Heon: Odd man machine is still very much ongoing and we're just trying to get test builds out the community so they can look at what works and what doesn't I'm expecting machine is probably going to be on what doesn't part for a while. But yeah, we are hoping to have a final release out but for Fedora 40 and ideally that's gonna be sometime in early March, but we don't want to commit strongly to that right now when there is still a lot of deaf work on going.\nBrent Baude: There's a subtlety. I'd like to add Matt that this morning. We talked with padman desktop folks and I think one or more of them is here. as well and I think we kind of came to a good conclusion or at least something I feel comfortable with which is as we're doing the releases and as podman 5 releases if you're extremely dependent on pod, I think the advice would be to just pause before jumping on top upon and five. give it a little bit of soap time and let a square off some of the yet sharp edges in particular with machine migration if we can do anything for folks and things like that, but this is something we're hoping that.\nBrent Baude: We can slow down and brew and don't release immediately. as we try to improve the user experience that we expect from ourselves.\nMatt Heon: Yeah, and hopefully most of us is going to get fixed up in RC. So. We'll see\u2026\nBrent Baude: Yep.\nMatt Heon: we'll see where we land and how much time we have. But I release candidates are going to start appearing and we are still very much in development. We're just trying to give people snapshots of where we are.\nBrent Baude: Matt I would just Bank this off you and you can drive it home, but also I would say that we feel very confident in the core pod, code and that base of code in terms of the things we've changed and that they're good and solidly done\nMatt Heon: Yeah, there are. Core pod man is very much stable at this point. Most of the instability is going to be coming in the machine side. That's probably why we're gonna end up doing so many RCS. So I think even rc1 is going to have a pretty complete preview of what you can expect in podman 50 if you don't expect to be using partnership,\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, I would also like to point out the breaking changes are probably not going to be noticed by 99% of the people in the world. It's\nBrent Baude: Unless you're on a Mac.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah. \u2026\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: but It's good news API for five hours.\nDaniel Walsh: I mean I'm talking about the Good.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: So is it client compatible? Otherwise? You will notice it. we noticed it between padman 3 and 4 because there's the new API so it's not API compatible, but\n00:50:00\nDaniel Walsh: But the API is pretty much the same. There's just certain field. So you're going to change because of compatibility with darker. So, certain you might programs that my break\u2026\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Okay,\nDaniel Walsh: because they're looking for. rs an uppercase ID being returned in the Json file or\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: but it will not outright break the way it did with the three and four so it will just refuse the connection there is no\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah. I would think it would.\nBrent Baude: Correct.\nMatt Heon: Yeah, that's something we might have a hard coded check for API version in there. But I think we can probably relax that we're not doing massive cranking changes between four and five they're gonna be small things pod man stats might be broken in the sense that we've changed some of the Json it might not the code properly but most commands most API endpoints still identical.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nBrent Baude: And big changes to the network. We could have Paul speak on that, but there's been some subtle. things done but not like when we came out with four and so I don't here's net of Arc and so forth\nMatt Heon: We are hoping to default to pasta for rootless containers as opposed to the current slope for net and S default, but that hasn't gotten yet. I'm actually going to be working on this afternoon. So\nTom Sweeney: Alright sounds like we're wrapping up and I thought we'd wrap up the meeting as well pretty quick. Here there any other questions for Matt's about this or about anything else from today? Okay.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: so if you want to test this new apartment 5, how would you Like to have a plan to get it in the hands of ubuntuous or Debian users or what have you.\nBrent Baude: We're not going to release binaries for the distroses. That was your asking.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: If we had a discussion whether it would be worse to have the linuxy resources pod manage machine compared to having them run Paul man B3, which is the word scenario running V3 in 2024 are running what mission that because it was triggered by what is nice blog post on how you can use pod man to run your Watson binaries. And it's Mac and Lynn Mac and windows users. You can use awesome binaries, but a lot of the Linux users were not able to follow that article because their apartment version was older than What was required in the article? so it doesn't\nDaniel Walsh: So it was many mainly Ubuntu users right on older they never update their apartment.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: yeah,\nDaniel Walsh: So they \u2026\nDaniel Walsh: the idea would be to install pod have Filed man remote statically and\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Okay.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: yeah,\nDaniel Walsh: then they could use that to launching machine.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: yeah, because that actually works it's like a plan B, so\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Obviously it would be nicer to have them run the apartment before So one thing I was experimenting is this week and what's the build podman B for using padman B3? I thought that was quick interesting and I have it running on Debian bullet science and so on so It seems to be working. Put it up. So that could be one way instead of the next bins because those were hard to maintain. So this one is not actually static. It's just building. They did the same for not CTL which requires new container data that are not available and a distro. So they just put all of the biners in the tarball and hope for the best. Same you can do for part man, if you're distribution is updated and you don't want to build it yourself from source.\nTom Sweeney: Okay, just need to wrap up here Anders. Can we have you contact Brenton or matt? would\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yes, but I think we can't follow up on coming meetings while will be a while.\nTom Sweeney: the special\nTom Sweeney: Okay, sounds great. Are there any other questions that people want to bring up or topics for next time? We do have a couple of topics already for next time having somebody come in to show us how to deploy llms with podman and kubernetes and we have podman manifest support broad effects and part man desktop. It's gonna be doing a demo. So if anybody has any other thoughts, please let me know or add them to the agendas move along as it's up after this. And one last chance for questions. Before we close out.\n00:55:00\nTom Sweeney: I'm not hearing anything. thank everybody especially the presenters today and I'm going to stop the recording.\nMeeting ended after 00:55:21\n")))}as.isMDXComponent=!0;const os={},is="Podman Community Cabal Meeting Notes",ss=[{value:"February 20, 2024 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-4)",id:"february-20-2024-1100-am-eastern-utc-4",level:2},{value:"Attendees",id:"attendees",level:3},{value:"February 20, 2024 Topics",id:"february-20-2024-topics",level:3},{value:"Meeting Notes",id:"meeting-notes",level:3},{value:"Podman, Kubernetes, and Image/Container Volumes - Matt, Dan (0:48 in the video)",id:"podman-kubernetes-and-imagecontainer-volumes---matt-dan-048-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Proposal to maintain podman-compose.

This is the padman community cabal meeting. We have a Agenda up in hack empty which I'll put into the meeting notes in a moment here today. We were going to be talking about pubman Cube to handle VMS too. But unfortunately the person who was going to leave that discussion is not here. So I'm gonna post that postpone that until the next time March.\nTom Sweeney: And what publicson welcome povilas and then we are going to talk about public kubernetes an image container volumes with Matt. And then finally we're going to be talking about proposal to maintain podman compose and then any open discussion that we may have after that. So given all that. I'm going to hand it off to you and Dan who's not quite here. You can take it.\nMatt Heon: I can at least try to get a started. So the ask here is originally coming from Dan who basically wants a way to get a image into an existing container. what I mean by this is we don't want to start a new container based on the image. We want to make the contents of the image available within an existing container as a volume and podman we can already do this. We have actually two ways of doing this. We have a concept of image volumes and we have a cons They're both called image volumes. It's horribly confusing one of them goes to the podman volume command. One of them doesn't anyways pod man an abundance of ways to get images into containers. And this is very convenient for things like security scanning.\nMatt Heon: However, the ask here is for a consistent way to do it that also works on kubernetes. we can basically have kubernet able that works in pod man and works in kubernetes and allows us to Mountain image both and I don't know if there's a good way to do that. It's certainly not any of the existing communities map types. You need to plug in or operator or something to do it.\nMatt Heon: I think we were counting on having Peter hunt here. Who is the cryo maintainer and would have a better idea of ways we could actually do this and we don't have Dan and we don't have Peter so we don't have\nTom Sweeney: It's just trying to pull up on select to see if I can ping either one of them, but we postpone it at least till later. And what we go ahead and move on to our next topic then which was a proposal to maintain augment composed in Publius. Am I saying in correctly?\nPovilas K: So I was not yes correctly.\nTom Sweeney: Okay, great. Do you want to start up the talk for us?\nPovilas K: Yeah, so basically what's the purpose of this so sometime ago I started using Pokemon compose due to some reasons as Port supports. Bodman itself better than let's say Docker compose in my case. I wanted to use gvisor for security purposes. And the undocker doesn't work properly on Boardman it does. and it turns out that Pokemon composes not maintained even though there is a lot of community interest in terms of open PRS and so on. so\nPovilas K: basically, I had to possible actions migrate off Pokemon compose and was something else entirely and second one is to actually The project and help and maintaining it so I chose the letter. And this is how the discussion starts? I wrote a bunch of emails and so on. And now I'm here. so I don't know. Doesn't have any questions at this point and I can answer this or can I continue?\nBrent Baude: I have questions, but I think I'll hold Till we get a little further.\n00:05:00\nPovilas K: so basically, we discussed the I think it was.\nPovilas K: Tom Sinny about how this could proceed and here is a bunch of concerns about the project itself. It's health. So I guess it makes sense to me to answer these not To town and private emails but so one was\nPovilas K: there was a concern that project is basically dying. There's no community and so on and this is by\nPovilas K: The focus of the government let's say project was put into Docker compose. And it doesn't make sense to shift the focus back to polmont compose just for it to die again in a year. which I give that concerns which it is reasonable and so on so I think that.\nPovilas K: in terms of the health of the project the community interest is much higher than it would seem because during the last half here. On average there was one pull request opened each week.\nPovilas K: this is not that by itself, but you need to keep in mind that. in a project there, it's obvious that it's not maintained. The maintenance is absent and doesn't require Polar Express and so on many potential contributors don't a popular requests and don't contribute and we don't see. Full community interest until the project is actually maintained and there's replies to issues and lower class so myself Im but positive in this area that project can live basically by itself. of course we would see but\nPovilas K: yeah.\nPovilas K: further concern was that again about the focus, basically What happens if the focuses which are switched? polymer composer on the dice so Pokemon project but itself is\nPovilas K: it is in worse position this way. and To this concern. I think let's reply would be that.\nPovilas K: I think it makes sense not to. Focus anywhere keep it like it is just leave the project love. And let's say not promote that Pokemon composes the accepted way to do compositive. or something like that and if it's not enough a personal liquid degree or not to promote compose as some very great project so that People will not be confused. In case let's say I lose interest in the command center here. So\nPovilas K: basically this would reduce the chances for any downsides. That maintaining the project but damage on. same former project anyway\nPovilas K: on the other hand, there are benefits that.\nPovilas K: It's possible to. Expose podman specifically what month the important console compose much better than the locker compose because of actually we cannot. expose permanent specific functionality there And for example, there could be Specific prefixes and the composer jump file and so on. And for example in my personal case hormone composer divorce Department better because gvisor works and Docker case. It doesn't properly for example, I couldn't start.\n00:10:00\nPovilas K: Docker compose exactly and the locker container which is using Giuseppe's basically not useful at all.\nPovilas K: So yeah, I think that's it. What about what I wanted to say?\nPovilas K: maybe about the state of the current status of the project internship So the current maintainer has been absent for I think seven months.\nPovilas K: I wrote. A total. not only me but during the discussion with Tom the secede the current maintainer we had on every email. So he got an email was during last two months, but one of Jenner. And I'm not aware of any reply. But we got from him.\nPovilas K: and the project itself he has been absent for six months and marriage a couple of bullet pull requests recently about two weeks ago and this broke Altus and thank you and\nPovilas K: for our activity for two weeks. So yeah, no indeed finished. So, what do you think?\nDaniel Walsh: so I opened up a\nDaniel Walsh: issue to basically add other maintainers to I package. But I specifically said that if he didn't show up for another month that we'd be able to do The problem I have is I'm not sure who to add. Do you think you able to do this are\nPovilas K: Was this question to me?\nDaniel Walsh: did you want to be a maintainer of podman compose?\nPovilas K: Me personally and I would take responsibility for making releases and making sure that God qualities good enough.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah. Yeah, the question I have is that a hostile Act?\nDaniel Walsh: and showing up but at this point If he's not responding, he's not responding any emails or anything like that, right?\nPovilas K: Not that I know.\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, and I sent a note or I don't know if it was a good Pub issue or whatever. Just after povilas and I first talked and there's been zero response to that and it was pretty pointed. are you there kind of thing?\nDaniel Walsh: All we gone a full month since I opened up that issue.\nBrent Baude: Just a little more data. So there's 278 issues. So that little repo has. Almost as more than half of what we have as a container runtime for unclosed issues.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nBrent Baude: It hasn't had a release in 10 months.\nBrent Baude: It's unfortunately in ora. But hasn't really iterated on versions of the 10 months.\nDaniel Walsh: Okay, I will do it if povilas can you ping me one week from today? Because that'll be a full month since I open that issue at that point. I will add you if he has not It's not commented on that then I'll add you as a maintainer at that point. You can add other maintainers to the project.\nBrent Baude: I swear at one time Foss had rules for hostile takeovers. they had a general guidelines.\nDaniel Walsh: this is not for boss. So this is for the GitHub. so that\nBrent Baude: I meant for this kind of situation is what I meant for projects that. the maintainer has gone in I swear that Foss wants release. these are the steps. We'd like to see people take anyways.\n00:15:00\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nBrent Baude: so if that occurs then\nBrent Baude: And we do that. We somewhat pouring salt on our own wound in the sense that The Branding around toddman composed has given us. fits\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nBrent Baude: So I'm wondering is if we feel that if we're saying. I guess publicly. We think pod man compulsion continue to exist if we do this. Which I've not necessarily opposed to but perhaps one thing we might want to ask is for a rebranding on the name.\nBrent Baude: So as part of it. change to some other name\nDaniel Walsh: decompose\nBrent Baude: I think that could be up to the new maintainer frankly, but I wonder if that is more of in the spirit of an open source.\nBrent Baude: Thing and then secondly, it kind of helps both parties. So I'm just explain where Bradley one of when I say that it's like putting salt on wounds What I mean, is that Dan and I and the team are frequently asked about supporting on men composed because or somebody has decided to use it in combination with their Rel subscription. And we really don't have anything to do with the project. Itself other than at one point we gave it a GitHub repo under containers. That's been basically our affiliation with it.\nBrent Baude: So I just would like us to consider that I'm not suggesting we have to do that, but that would help both parties. in my mind and would be a cleaner break. So we technically more calling us a fork I think. supposed to take over\nPovilas K: I can comment on that from my perspective. So I think that.\nBrent Baude: Thank you.\nPovilas K: Portman compose just being an under container suppository gives it. Let's say a common economical place where developers who want this kind of functionality can meet.\nPovilas K: it helps the project attract contributions. Just by being under container suppository. and now in terms of Itself, I understand this concern. I wonder if it would be possible to explain that. common compose is\nPovilas K: composed support for podman But Portman team doesn't maintain it.\nPovilas K: the best user can do is to open initial on formal r compository. And wait for answer. Is it possible to consider this or rename would be better from this regard? Because I consider that for then the developers who could contribute to Portland compose would basically\nPovilas K: Wouldn't have a clear place together. And wouldn't be incentivized contribute. Let's say if the project is placed outside of containers would help organization,\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: We're not suggesting that we move it outside of containers.\nPovilas K: then it's just running project. Why?\nBrent Baude: Correct. But yeah,\u2026\nPovilas K: Okay, okay.\nDaniel Walsh: with so the\nBrent Baude: we would be happy to continue to have it there. Maybe just looking for a new project name.\nPovilas K: Okay.\nBrent Baude: Sure, of course. Yep.\nDaniel Walsh: Sleep the big confusion comes in is that we have a pod man space composed command now, which will execute either darker compose or pod man compose depending on what you have installed. And people are surprised when it isn't podman Dash compose. And that's where the naming, Just basically\u2026\n00:20:00\nPovilas K: Right, right.\nDaniel Walsh: what we want to support. yeah, I don't think supports the correct term, but we want to allow people to use compose.\nDaniel Walsh: Yaml files against podman. That's our main goal. and the easier thing for us to support since we have to support it is\nDaniel Walsh: Is Docker composed because that talks to our API server? Whereas if there's a bug in pod man composed None of the people that tain pod man composed. We don't work on that. So that's where the pod man composers talking to the client and Doctor composers talking to the API server.\nPovilas K: Okay.\nDaniel Walsh: So anyways, let's do that this week and we'll rename the thing to be P compose and If that's okay with you, do you like that name?\nPovilas K: I can think about it. but\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, all right.\nPovilas K: For now,\u2026\nBrent Baude: Why don't you think about it?\nPovilas K: it makes sense.\nBrent Baude: and Then we can use that same issue. You can put a name in there. before we do the swap. I asked Tom a private question,\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: Yep.\nBrent Baude: but I'm gonna put them on the spot now.\nBrent Baude: This is a little bit also, maybe I shouldn't offer this but we could blog about this change on podmanio what we can provide with an opportunity to blog about this on podmin iO to get the word out that Essentially, this is what's going on. And this is the intent. and that you intend to\nBrent Baude: Begin, reviewing and merging and all the normal Upstream activities.\nPovilas K: I think that for now it makes sense not to do that. Just silently.\nBrent Baude: Okay.\nPovilas K: But silently Revival project and that's a because again, what happens if I lose interest in half year. Let's say I'm not\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, that's why I want you to get other maintainers on this so that there's more than So we don't have a single point of failure that we have right now. so\u2026\nPovilas K: Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: if you can get a couple other people were actively looking to maintain it and that would be the best possible outcome and I would still allow. A capital's name that current the person. I originally created to continue to work on it as well as a maintainer.\nBrent Baude: Yeah, the other bit was I gave a Koji link there. Does anyone know the person that was building it? profodora Gwyn Maybe I'm pronouncing that correctly.\nMartin Jackson: It's going sequence.\nLokesh Mandvekar: Yeah.\nMartin Jackson: He's one of the main she may change a lot of packages.\nBrent Baude: Okay, so this is more like probably something fell out of. Maintaining ship and she ended up with it.\nMartin Jackson: Yes. Yes, I remember because I was involved in that threat on the Fedora list.\nBrent Baude: Okay.\nTom Sweeney: So going forward again in public. We'll get this phone up and see where it goes and perhaps and\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nTom Sweeney: have some updates at the future ball meetings.\nDaniel Walsh: So the 26 is one month after I wrote that email. So I mean that issue.\nTom Sweeney: Sounds good. It's Loveless. Thanks.\nPaul Holzinger: it's also also clear that the maintainer head activity on the repo to weeks ago and if he doesn't respond to Depending on guitar or emails, and I don't know, there's much we can do it other than ask him and If that doesn't want them.\nDaniel Walsh: I'm not gonna remove him as a maintainer. I'm just gonna add other maintainers. I think that's\u2026\nPaul Holzinger: yeah, I think that's yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: how we Yeah.\nPovilas K: from my point of view If a repositor is under containers organization, then the end owner of repository is containers or organization. And the current maintainer is bound to its rules. And if he doesn't agree then another material can be chosen or red. And then let's say half a year of inactivity I guess is not Good enough level of maintainership.\n00:25:00\nPovilas K: Containers organization than chosen our maintainer and the current maintainer if he wants to maintain the project the current level of activity he can do it in his own.\nDaniel Walsh: Yep.\nPovilas K: Fork\nBrent Baude: In any action we take would we be keeping the current maintainer on the list of owners? So no permissions would be revoked at this time. very well.\nPovilas K: Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: right Until unless he started act hostile to exist and then we might have to take action.\nBrent Baude: I frankly don't think you have to wait another week to just add him as a maintainer,\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: But yeah.\nBrent Baude: but that would be my two cents.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, I convert that could be done. I also think that we're kind of fuzzy about our roles for a situational like this and there's a takeaway. This might be something we want to add somewhere in the containers or itself what happens when the maintainer disappears?\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nTom Sweeney: Yeah. I don't think we have that very well specified. And would be good to list what are the steps that we'll be taking to move them or\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: it's The first time it's happened.\nTom Sweeney: not? Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: So I mean probably a lot of dead projects on containers, but this is the more first one where people are very interested in bringing it back to life.\nTom Sweeney: pushing forward\nBrent Baude: So that's the question given the Upstream situation here. should\nBrent Baude: Department composed not be carried forward to Fedora 40 right now.\nBrent Baude: Martin lokesh\nLokesh Mandvekar: I don't think we control\nPovilas K: Should not be.\nBrent Baude: I'm sorry.\nLokesh Mandvekar: whenever there's\nBrent Baude: I didn't hear either.\nLokesh Mandvekar: If you want to go ahead.\nPovilas K: I just wanted to double check should not put Pokemon compose in. Fedora Forte or\nBrent Baude: I was wondering if it should be not move forward but I think we would have needed to meet a date much earlier. but\nMartin Jackson: I think the package might already be in the Fedora 40 composes.\nPovilas K: a further question so about this previous discussion about the name and so on so just let's say imagine that the podmon compose takes the best possible path and this properly maintained and rich as part of the docker components on\nPovilas K: So question I want to ask. What we still consider the naming issues in that situation. let's say a problem composer was maintenance and good quality All the time. So what we consider when having still\nTom Sweeney: I'm not sure. No.\nDaniel Walsh: So I guess the question is the repo important or is the package name inside of Fedora are important.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nBrent Baude: my two cents would be that if it was properly maintained we would have no Notification for coming in and no cause to come in and ask for a name change as part of anything, but that would be my sense. I still however wouldn't like it. But I don't think any action I wouldn't be advocating for action. And usually I'm the more aggressive of the bunch.\nMartin Jackson: so would\nPovilas K: Maybe\nPovilas K: Maybe it makes sense.\nMartin Jackson: Sorry, go ahead photos.\nPovilas K: Maybe make some stupid half a year and see what happens. And if you are not satisfied and then your name project.\nDaniel Walsh: Sounds good.\nChristopher Evich: Just had quickly.\nBrent Baude: Think we can. live with that\nChristopher Evich: Renaming stuff can be problematic. Far as the internet goes and links and stuff, especially. the project gets popular and gets blog articles pointing to it and It could cause some issues.\nBrent Baude: So is that a vote of doing it now before it gets even more popular?\nChristopher Evich: Yeah, I would say to either do it earlier. Don't do it at all and I have no problem. Took up real to say either way.\n00:30:00\nMartin Jackson: And there are definitely some well understood mechanisms within Fedora to do a package name change like that.\nTom Sweeney: All right. I'm just looking at the clock and looking at the couple other topics that we have so during wrap this up somehow perhaps\nBrent Baude: I think we're ready. we decided we wait one week. And then on and then Adam is an owner.\nDaniel Walsh: Yep.\nMartin Jackson: he\nBrent Baude: depending on the original maintainers. actions we have sort of delayed the possibility of a name change.\nDaniel Walsh: Sounds good.\nPovilas K: So how much time would they have so half a year was suggestion? What would be you'll be comfortable with?\nDaniel Walsh: Sure.\nDaniel Walsh: Let's see how it goes in six months.\nBrent Baude: How about before? So anyone happen to have the Fedora 41 schedule?\nMatt Heon: It would be about October call it.\nBrent Baude: not why I know that's the release but when's the proposal for name changes have to be in\nMartin Jackson: because\nMatt Heon: I don't know if they finalize it. I will check but\nBrent Baude: okay, so what we can dig that up, but my personal opinion would be decided by then. And if you don't decide then decide by the one in the spring being just as a natural guideline.\nTom Sweeney: Okay.\nTom Sweeney: Anything else on this? I've been trying to move it along trying right gonna look back to the original topic since Peter and Dan are here now. We were talking about odd man kubernetes and image container volumes Matt. You want to kick off where we want?\nMatt Heon: Sure, I mean Dan this is really your show but the general ask here is that we want a consistent way of having an image that gets mounted into a container not gets created into a container business mounted into an existing container that works on both podman and on kubernetes. Does that sound accurate Dan?\nDaniel Walsh: Yep.\nMatt Heon: and I\nBrent Baude: Why do I want this?\nDaniel Walsh: What people are looking? we have multiple pull requests where our multiple people talking about mechanisms for data around to be used with containers so that the one I'm interested in is the\nDaniel Walsh: And AI model, which is usually a massive multi gigabyte size data stream. and people want to run that in both open shift and with podman and in pod man was saying package it into a container image, then you can push to a registry and pull it. And then mounted as an image into a volume. There there's a pull request of right now where someone is doing some very similar where they want to take. Volumes of image and not have a container running but take the volumes from an image and not them into. a kubernetes yaml file and really what I'm looking for is that if Peter or others have ever heard of something like this in standard kubernetes because I don't want to have a pod man only way of doing this with a kubernet channel.\nPeter Hunt: There is a project. that did and I'm probably gonna sail to find it on the spot right now.\nPeter Hunt: But it's a vault. basically kubernetes is a concept of the volume plugins. So all the clouds can have their wasted inject the volume into container, but someone created a volume plugin for mounting an image into container and I think it actually does use container storage.\nPeter Hunt: So that project does exist. CSI driver,\u2026\nGerry Seidman: Okay.\nPeter Hunt: that's the phrase so container storage interface driver.\nPeter Hunt: but wiring that into pod man would be tricky so you could have the same sort of interface but it wouldn't work exactly the same because there wouldn't be this extra process to actually doing the volume Management on the Note itself.\n00:35:00\nDaniel Walsh: But is there a way in the kubernetes GMO file to specify you want to use one of those?\nGerry Seidman: Then I used to be very active in these storage Community. I haven't attended in a year. the person who would be a good source to know would be Michelle Howard at Google. Because she's kind of the cat herder and would be wearable the projects in kubernetes storage. I have a contact information.\nDaniel Walsh: could you send me the contact information?\nGerry Seidman: actually\nDaniel Walsh: I just don't want to have something, possible if there was a way that people tend to do this with kubernetes yaml file then we could Write the similar yaml file for podman and then have podman interpret That mechanism rather than that's correct creating something for the whole cloth.\nPeter Hunt: Yeah.\nPeter Hunt: But part man currently have support for some CSI drivers like the one that makes sense host path and stuff like that. So would look similar to that support basically,\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: right\nPeter Hunt: but you would specify different type.\nDaniel Walsh: but an image path and then I'd have the name of the image something like that.\nPeter Hunt: Something like that. Yeah, and if you wanted to base it off of this existing project which I'm still trying to find then they would have the API that you could emulate already, but It's not built into Cube itself. So it wouldn't immediately translate into Cube you'd have to load the TSI driver first and then Use it so it would be direct sort of. presentation\nDaniel Walsh: right\nDaniel Walsh: my goal would be that could take that lunch inside of openshift is That likely to happen.\nPeter Hunt: Yeah, you'd have to deploy that CSI driver. We had talked about it a while ago, but we didn't really have a concrete use case for it. So we didn't do it. So I think we'd really need a compelling use case to included an open trip by default, but I wouldn't be surprised if they would Operator aside and then it would be easy to deploy on openshift. And then we just have to remember to do that before applying the analog from service but\nDaniel Walsh: Right, so I'll talk to. Jeremy Eder about this and see if because I think this is something that's going to be coming in the AI models. That are being generated.\nDaniel Walsh: just because you don't really want to have your application and the AI model in the same container image. and So that's the use case. I'm hearing a lot about and as I said this person opened up a pull request for a different use case, but it seems similar that they wanted to be able to ship something as to know CIA image and use it as a volume.\nPeter Hunt: Yeah, someone who's been on the cryo team on my team. Sohan has been looking at a similar use case, but also with sea run Walsham, but using oci artifact as sort of a volume that would allow for transporting it. So we're thinking about this a little bit too. Would you include me in that conversation with Jeremy and we can try to find a unified for a path.\nDaniel Walsh: Sure.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, and artifact it, there's one of those things is that affect the right thing. I don't know. It's\nPeter Hunt: Tactically it would be I mean probably eventually you'd probably want a defined artifact type for this model. So then the engines could interpret that type and\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: yeah.\nPeter Hunt: know that it's not actually gonna run anything. It's going to be injected in as the volume or something like that, but that would take negotiation the oci which I don't think it's really been done yet.\nDaniel Walsh: right All right, Gerry, so if you can send me an email with the contact information.\nPeter Hunt: Thank you.\nDaniel Walsh: And then I'll follow up with Peter and\u2026\nGerry Seidman: Yeah, keep looking for them.\nDaniel Walsh: Jeremy to talk further.\nGerry Seidman: I'm not finding it right away, but I'll keep looking.\nTom Sweeney: And you have Dan's contact info jury. I put it in the chat if you don't.\nGerry Seidman: Yeah, I do. I have danced nothing. Now I found it.\nDaniel Walsh: He has my contact information.\nGerry Seidman: I found it.\nDaniel Walsh: And Peter,\u2026\nPeter Hunt: just\nDaniel Walsh: have you ever heard of anybody using volume from? type construct and\nPeter Hunt: look these volume from not what no, let us.\nDaniel Walsh: so, not darker invented basically around one container and then you can say run a second container with the volume is from the first container. shade into this container\nPeter Hunt: because kubernetes like things about pods all there's the volume which is separate from the container.\n00:40:00\nDaniel Walsh: right\nPeter Hunt: No but you can do it. it's not that you don't put the container idea like the Pod name. You just share the volume among different pods. So\nDaniel Walsh: yeah, that would seem to make more sense but I think we had images then we'd be able to satisfy. The person was looking for why I'm a scrum inside of a club. So\nPeter Hunt: And I don't know I think I did find the CSI container energy suicide driver. So I posted it in chat. And Ice I don't know if there's where it's gonna live long-term. It looks like they're going through some renaming stuff but maybe an acquisition happens or something like that, but there's I think so when I was like we were looking at a while ago.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, at least it looks like it's a little bit active so. As the two weeks ago.\nPeter Hunt: So they're using quite an old version of cryo. So, who knows? but three minutes\nDaniel Walsh: We move on to the next one Tom.\nTom Sweeney: And at the moment, that would be open discussions. didn't have no proposal for that. We had something from Vivek about modern Cube to handle VMS to Dan. I don't know if you want to talk about that now today or wait till he's here. He's on vacation. Thank you forgot about this vacation time.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh:\nDaniel Walsh: that I think basically the basic idea right now we have Cooper which is basically taking a VM putting it inside of a container image and then all the tooling to run the\nDaniel Walsh: Run the Q go to inside of kubert.\nDaniel Walsh: We've recently created a package called c-run VM. which is a oci runtime that we'll use the Cuke out qmu from it's defaulted to qmu, but we'll run Q mu from The Host. And take the content of the image and run and basically look for a q cow too inside of the image and run the use case we're looking for is basically like a quadlet where you'd have a machine boot up and you want to have a VM that's managed as a container.\nDaniel Walsh: So, inside the quadlight you can set its c groups you can set it's different flags things like that and then have it So we have support for that by specifying the oci runtime inside of the quadlet and What's been asked about Basically, is there a way that we could use? Kubernetes GMO file which I believe has the mechanism to specify an oci runtime inside of the ammo file and do something similar.\nDaniel Walsh: And Peter, do you know if I'm talking truth or am I making things up?\nPeter Hunt: So yeah, there are. So cubic provides an API for creating VMS and that's seven from the Pod API to look like the cupid API is like it's own. API embed like it's integrated into kubernetes the cubic crd.\nDaniel Walsh: right\nPeter Hunt: So yeah, there is the cute Brent API which you could sort of emulate that they did just semi recently last couple of months reach one. so at the stable API now which would be a good time to sort of adopt it and\u2026\nDaniel Walsh: We're actually.\nPeter Hunt: it I would\nDaniel Walsh: We're not talking about the coup bird API we're talking. Is there a mechanism right now to specify I want to use Sea run instead of unsafe.\nPeter Hunt: yes the Pandora runtime class mechanism. So kubernetes there's an extra sort of type A runtime. Class and you define a runtime class and then it basically just maps to a string name. And then in the CRI implementation the cryo that it would have to be configured to have that main map to something so You could have a runtime class. We created in pod man, and then have that run and then pods would use that runtime class.\nDaniel Walsh: So basically the idea this would be a dumb down version of Cooper. and that you could just take A container image and\u2026\nPeter Hunt: I see.\n00:45:00\nDaniel Walsh: use and specify the runtime class of sea run I see run via and that would basically use qmu to launch a launch the cute cow, too that's inside of the image. That's all it would \u2026\nPeter Hunt: right\nDaniel Walsh: and that you've got to that could be a Windows machine. It could be any type of machine but not taking advantage of any API.\nPeter Hunt: Yeah, so yeah the runtime class I posted the Lincoln chat that you would want pod man to learn to have the runtime class as an object.\nDaniel Walsh: There what?\nPeter Hunt: It understands and then the Pod itself could I guess you wouldn't even necessarily to create the runtime class. You could just have it. there's a pod of runtime class name and you could just have that map to whatever runtime you wanted to use.\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah, that's probably exactly what we want. And obviously I don't want to compete against kubert but Cooper won't work currently doesn't run with pod man, because we have to have some API server, which we don't have so This would be a simpler mechanism for just running the amps on any thought man.\nPeter Hunt: right\nDaniel Walsh: And then theoretically we could pass that on to cryo and have it run, the same workloads.\nDaniel Walsh: That's good. I'll bring that back.\nDaniel Walsh: as a mechanism\nTom Sweeney: Vivic watches the videos for me, so he'll probably hop on there too. right any question\nDaniel Walsh: The sea run VM should be packaged for Fedora very soon. It should be in 40.\nTom Sweeney: Right, we're running up to the end of our hour here and just want to open up for any further discussions or questions that anybody might have.\nGerry Seidman: Then you should have an email Michelle. So I picked information now.\nTom Sweeney: here in the whole\nGerry Seidman: and that It was interested in Sig storage. That's the landing page for that\nGerry Seidman: in chat\nTom Sweeney: And sort of passing that along Jerry. Let's go for open questions. And I'll just put up a reminder that our next ball meeting and it's not February 20th. I don't have the exact date. You'll be the third Tuesday in March. Which looks to be March 19th, I'll change that in the agenda. And then our next community meeting is in April and that's on the first Tuesday of the month on April 2nd. We're looking for topics for both of those. We do have one possible topic for the next time around currently. We have a cui IO namespace for containers podman building and scopio. We're considering dropping that. So if you have any thoughts about that, please send us along to me. And again one last chance for questions.\nTom Sweeney: quite punch\nKevin Clevenger: Vikas, did you want to discuss in a containers?\nVikas Goel: he I'm from\u2026\nGerry Seidman: Okay.\nVikas Goel: where it does. Technologies And the use case here I have is primarily around data protection as a backup appliances. the appliances we are building is based on real a.8 right now and it runs very tasks proprietary in a backup applications. And there are two or three different use cases I have and I don't think in the next 10 minute.\nGerry Seidman: Okay.\nVikas Goel: I'm going to be able to finish that so it can how do I include some topics or send you topics for next meeting?\nTom Sweeney: Yep, I've put my email and in the chat and messages and then you can also just put them directly into the agenda here which I've included in. chat and vikas Tom's when you read\u2026\nVikas Goel: Okay.\nTom Sweeney: how didn't get up if you want to read that way as well.\nVikas Goel: Okay, cool. Thank you so much. I'll add that over there. Yeah.\nTom Sweeney: Okay, Yeah be happy to have more topics always looking for good topics.\nVikas Goel: Yeah.\nGerry Seidman: that actually makes me think of going back to the data in a container image But why do they want to do that? I mean they're taking advantage of the overlay file system. because the reason I thought of that is I just remembered in kubernetes something that people do is they have an init container, but really it's because reminded me they have an innate container that will download from a good repo or a tar file or something expand the content into a shared volume from between the init container and the application container.\n00:50:00\nGerry Seidman: So that's how some people are doing. obtaining data you don't get the caching that you would get with it was downloaded as a container but\nVikas Goel: So if I were to explain my use case over here, as I talked about backup application netbackup.\nVikas Goel: And this is Appliance right physical appliance that customer deploys is not connected to Cloud as such\u2026\nGerry Seidman: space problem\nVikas Goel: where you can just go to registry and download it. It runs in a very secured environment and environment where the appliances don't have access to outside world.\nGerry Seidman: I was going the other way. I wasn't saying that this would be a solution for you. I was saying that what you said reminded me of how people were using an incontainers to address the issue the danboro.\nVikas Goel: Okay.\nDaniel Walsh: I mean the first of all having a container doesn't add any value there, It's\nGerry Seidman: exactly\nDaniel Walsh: yeah, so really what we want is we want to have a relationship between a container and in an image That is both Can live independently. So again using the AI model you have this huge model. Gigabytes in size and that can get updated periodically and that could be used by multiple containers. So you might have four or five six different apps that are all using a model\nDaniel Walsh: so the question is how does that AI model get on to my kubernetes cluster or how does it get on to my Edge device. So how do I get updates the managed device and\nGerry Seidman: Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: There's no real container involved in this it's just the data and\u2026\nGerry Seidman: Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: and I'm surprised that this doesn't come up more often and just what they AI. It just screams for us up like this.\nGerry Seidman: yeah, but we have lots of customers doing that but We just have a CSI driver and a distributed file system with good caching.\nDaniel Walsh: But obviously you can do this is the file systems,\u2026\nGerry Seidman: Okay,\nDaniel Walsh: but that's not Cloud native, Yeah. yeah, I mean a lot of case you probably better off doing it as not moving gigabytes a day or\u2026\nGerry Seidman: .\nDaniel Walsh: around and using some kind of shed network storage to do it It just come up.\nGerry Seidman: right\nDaniel Walsh: It's like, but if you thought about it as Hey, I have this really cool AI app I want you to try. And we could say hi. Okay, how do I get it? go Download this quadlet and run it on your system and the quad that then would take care of downloading all the yeah.\nGerry Seidman: just yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: as we say\nDaniel Walsh: Download the quad let's start the quad that and go to lunch because when you get back, it'll be ready to run because it's gonna take an hour and\u2026\nGerry Seidman: Problems. Yeah.\nDaniel Walsh: so how do you deal in them in that world, right? Yeah.\nGerry Seidman: Yeah, and that's I think in the kubernetes world the way they deal with that is they put the model and GitHub they and it container. That does that.

This is the Pod man Community cabal eating today. We have three topics. However, a couple of our folks aren't here yet. So may have to delay on some of these the first one up for today was Data production for appliance backup application pick a school Goyle and seeing vicas. Did anybody hear from him?\nKevin Clevenger: I have not.\nTom Sweeney: And then the next was podman rootless containers do not populate the IP by Depeche Verma, and I did not hear about this one. So just about five minutes ago. Has anybody talked with the pastor and recommended that he joined for this or she I should say?\nTom Sweeney: Okay, and then the only other topic we had we're discussing just before we came on that. We had talked within our internal cabal and that's about Paul man reverse dependency testing and containers common.\nTom Sweeney: Matt always thinking that there was a whole lot more to discuss about that. Did you have anything you wanted to mention or at least give a quick overview and what the decisions were made?\nMatt Heon: So basically the problem here that we are trying to solve is this we have a couple different repositories that code that eventually lands in pod man lives in we have obviously the base libraries contain storage containers image. Then we have a containers common Library which has a bunch of shared code between our projects and then we have Builder and then we have pot man. So there is a rather substantial chain of code that eventually lands in pot man has dependencies. The desire here was to add some sort of reverse testing within at least some of these repository starting with containers common to basically ensure that changing the tears common is guaranteed to not break pot man because we were having some problems with that during the Pod man five cycle. We commit a change from cares common. It wouldn't be adequately tested land in pod man. Then we\nMatt Heon: to go back and tears common and fix things before we actually got the change into podman. So we have decided that we are going to start doing this lokesh is investig doing it using the door of Test forest framework. And once we have at least basic testing implemented, we think this is going to be a big benefit to our overall development workflow in dependency library of admin basically ensuring we don't have any question as to whether Are going to work when we go and put them into podman. yeah, I think that's about it. I summarize Paul lakash or anything I missed.\nPaul Holzinger: Yeah, I think we discussed it last week at the internal combo, but you weren't there. I think.\nMatt Heon: Okay.\nPaul Holzinger: so What I remember maybe lokesh can at that. We agreed on having his test PR for now.\nPaul Holzinger: testing just about because testing all appointments this probably too much to\nLokesh Mandvekar: Yeah, that's about right I'll be adding for now. My plan is to add apartment and build a build tests. as part of the STI. So basically gets vendored Fund in Builder and partner and I said and if they build okay. That's something.\nMatt Heon: Okay, I think that is our answer there. We're going to do it and yeah. Tom that's about it other stuff I\nTom Sweeney: Okay, the other two topics I believe looking at the folks. We don't have Here who's going to talk about on data production for appliances? And then we were going to have to push here Content realistic time. It's not populating the IP. Is there anybody here knows about those that would like to discuss this or get it discussion started. Or should we put these off to the next couple meeting next month?\nPaul Holzinger: I mean I can answer why there's the basically the default routers container like slope for naliness or pasta are in a separate namespace and you cannot reach this So even if you would put IP in there You would have no way to run there. So the IP doesn't Give you anything. It would add more confusion in my opinion if I cannot be reached from externally.\n00:05:00\nPaul Holzinger: We do support. destination network bridge as ruthless and that gives you shows your IP now, but it's also not routable from the host Network namespace. But this IP would be routable between the containers. So that makes sense.\nTom Sweeney: then that might be an extremely quick meeting. Just anybody have anything else that they would like to talk about today have any topics? Almost I can possibly matter. I don't know if you want to talk about 5.0. And where it's at.\nMatt Heon: This will be a very brief update the release R has been made. We're holding off until after lunch Us East Coast time. Once that happens. We will have everyone ready to do the final release tasks and Given that I expect about three hours from now, we will have a 50 tagged and ready for testing.\nTom Sweeney: was great.\nTom Sweeney: right still not seeing any of these folks that were supposed to be here for this. I'm gonna give it one last call for any other topics or questions.\nTom Sweeney: If not, I know there are a bunch of us that have a bunch of work to get going to so I think of me practice meeting up extremely early.\nTom Sweeney: of hearing anything going once going twice\nTom Sweeney: Right, it's gone. I mean you start stop the recording here and we'll wrap up meeting. Thanks for coming folks and sorry so quick.\n")))}gs.isMDXComponent=!0;const ys={},ws="Podman Community Meeting Notes",fs=[{value:"April 2, 2024 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-4)",id:"april-2-2024-1100-am-eastern-utc-4",level:2},{value:"Attendees",id:"attendees",level:3},{value:"Topics",id:"topics",level:3},{value:"Meeting Start: 11:02  a.m. EDT",id:"meeting-start-1102--am-edt",level:2},{value:"Video Recording",id:"video-recording",level:3},{value:"Podman Desktop update demo",id:"podman-desktop-update-demo",level:2},{value:"Tim deBoer",id:"tim-deboer",level:3},{value:"(2:50 in the video)",id:"250-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Deploy LLMs with Podman and K8s",id:"deploy-llms-with-podman-and-k8s",level:2},{value:"Steffen R\xf6cker",id:"steffen-r\xf6cker",level:3},{value:"(8:55 in the video)",id:"855-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"<code>podman manifest</code> support for artifacts",id:"podman-manifest-support-for-artifacts",level:2},{value:"Nalin Dahyabhai",id:"nalin-dahyabhai",level:3},{value:"([25:08(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8l3vGcT3fo&amp;t=1508s) in the video)",id:"2508httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv-8l3vgct3fot1508s-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"podman v5.0.1 Update",id:"podman-v501-update",level:2},{value:"Matt Heon",id:"matt-heon",level:3},{value:"(33:12 in the video)",id:"3312-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Open Forum/Questions?",id:"open-forumquestions",level:2},{value:"Topics for Next Meeting",id:"topics-for-next-meeting",level:2},{value:"Next Meeting: Tuesday, June 4, 2024, 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-4)",id:"next-meeting-tuesday-june-4-2024-1100-am-eastern-utc-4",level:2},{value:"Next Cabal Meeting: Tuesday, April 16, 2024, 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-5)",id:"next-cabal-meeting-tuesday-april-16-2024-1100-am-eastern-utc-5",level:2},{value:"Meeting End: 11:39 a.m. Eastern (UTC-5)",id:"meeting-end-1139-am-eastern-utc-5",level:3},{value:"Google Meet Chat copy/paste:",id:"google-meet-chat-copypaste",level:2},{value:"Raw Google Meet Transcription",id:"raw-google-meet-transcription",level:2}],ks={toc:fs},bs="wrapper";function vs(e){let{components:t,...n}=e;return(0,Ne.kt)(bs,(0,ce.Z)({},ks,n,{components:t,mdxType:"MDXLayout"}),(0,Ne.kt)("h1",{id:"podman-community-meeting-notes"},"Podman Community Meeting Notes"),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"april-2-2024-1100-am-eastern-utc-4"},"April 2, 2024 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-4)"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"attendees"},"Attendees"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Ashley Cui, Brent Baude, Ed Santiago Munoz, Giuseppe Scrivano, Jake Correnti, Jhon Honce, Kevin Clevenger, Lokesh Mandvekar, Mark Russell, Matt Heon, Miloslav Trmac, Mohan Boddu, Nalin Dahyabhai, Neil Smith, Paul Holzinger, Rahil Bhimjiani, Steffen R\xf6cker,  Tim deBoer, Tim deBoer's Presentation, Tom Sweeney, Tom Sweeney's Presentation, Urvashi Mohnani"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"topics"},"Topics"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"1) Deploy LLMs with Podman and K8s - Steffen R\xf6cker\n2) podman manifest support for artifacts - Nalin Dahyabhai\n3) Podman Desktop update demo - Steve deBoer\n4) Podman v5.0 Update - Matt Heon"),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"meeting-start-1102--am-edt"},"Meeting Start: 11:02  a.m. EDT"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"video-recording"},"Video ",(0,Ne.kt)("a",{parentName:"h3",href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8l3vGcT3fo"},"Recording")),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"DEVCONF.US is happening on August 14-16, 2024 in Boston, MA.

This is April 2nd 2024. This is the podman community meeting. In this meeting, we generally do demos of interests for things related to Paul man, generally, but oftentimes Builders scopio and other container projects as well. So we're always happy to take any kind of discussion topics that you may have for the future. Please let me know you have eating notes inside of a heck MD which you can go ahead and update it more time that you want to go ahead and add a topic although I do appreciate having noticed to me also. And so for today, we have a number of topics. We have deploying llms with podman and kubernetes with Stefan roecker and Stefan my messing up your name.\nTom Sweeney: I misspelling it. At least I see.\nSteffen Roecker: That's fine. No.\nTom Sweeney: Okay, and then not only be talking about podman manifest support effects. Then Tim will be talking about doing a quick problem and just top update demo Force Special on the areas that are Jewish. Matt's going to be talking about 501 updates and then we'll have room for any miscellaneous topics that people would like to see and then just as a quick reminder. Our next meeting will be on Tuesday, June 4th. And then a quick note from our sponsor. Urvashi, do you want to talk through this? So do you want me to\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: A store. Are you sharing your slides Stone? Because I don't see anything.\nTom Sweeney: dear. That was not very good.\nTom Sweeney: Try that.\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: Yeah, perfect. So just a quick announcement that Defcon for us is a free open source conference that red hot sponsors and the Boston area. It happens at Boston University. So we're back in person this year in August. I shoot up with the dates on the slide, but it's August the 16th. If you scan the QR code, it'll take you to our website. The CFB is currently open till April 22nd. So we really encourage, anyone on the open source Community. Please submit talks. We have a lot of interesting tracks and themes for this year. Yep. That's it. Thank you, Tom.\nTom Sweeney: No problem.\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: All right.\nTom Sweeney: Already, was that going to turn over to Steffen and talking about llms?\nSteffen Roecker: And we can also switch. It's fine for my side.\nTom Sweeney: Oops, I'm sorry. I barely hear you.\nTim deBoer: Yeah, I put a comment in if possible. I'd like to go in the first half hour. But if you want to go first Steffen.\nTom Sweeney: Okay.\nTom Sweeney: Or no Timothy, if you guys don't mind switching we'll just go ahead and switch that up now. And we'll go with him first.\nTim deBoer: Okay, so I don't have any big demo or presentation to show. I just wanted to talk through the podman desktop 1.8 release. So this has been out for a few weeks now. and I'm just going to kind of run through what are the features and changes? The first is by default. It will install podman 493 you'll notice right off that I actually am running padman 5 it does work with podman 5 just fine and I'll talk about that more at the end. And so what have we added this release first is what we call Global onboarding it basically means if you've never used podman desktop before and you started up after the welcome will prompt you to install podman.\nTim deBoer: Help create your first pod man machine will kind of walk you through that process and make sure that There is onboarding for podman itself for Docker compose using podman and over time. We'll probably add more things there if you skip that you can go to settings and do it again later, but we just want to make sure that when people do their first install, they can get a working environment with everything configured right off the bat. The next thing is we've added a Learning Center here. It's basically just a set of cards with common things that people want to set up using a corkus spring Boot and you just click on these it opens up the documentation page for how to get started with those things.\nTim deBoer: We got it a bunch of API improvements for extensions to do new things. I won't get into the detail on that here. There's a bunch of minor things like when you do a build. We'll prompt you for which platforms you want to build for you can select that on the build page? And the other big thing is the support for kubernetes. So I have kind running on podman right now and we have this new section in the left here support for deployments services and ingresses in routes, actually me. Delete that one. So there's a bunch of related things. But the first is that you can apply yaml you can just pick. Yaml, it does the same as Kube cuddle apply.\n00:05:00\nTim deBoer: stands up those resources. You can see here that EML had a bunch of deployments and Services. I can now see them within podman desktop. You can go to details for any of these, the normal things that you'd want to do is a kubernetes developer. There's also support for making changes to these I won't apply now, but, you can edit the animal directly and apply it. And delete anything from here.\nTim deBoer: So yeah, I guess first any questions on what I've shown.\nTim deBoer: Yeah, go ahead. I didn't see who's and that was.\nTim deBoer: real or that just a thumbs up.\nTom Sweeney: I heard the peak too, but I don't see anybody with hand up.\nTim deBoer: Yeah, So that's it for the release. There's a blog post on podman desktop.io that goes into a bit more detail and has some screenshots and then I just wanted to talk about podman 5 for a minute. There is a release of podman desktop imminent 1.9 release in the next couple days the big change there will be if you don't have pod man installed in your machine will offer to install podman 5.0 not 4.9.\nTim deBoer: And then there's an experimental option in the settings. If you turn that on we'll add a button to update from 4.9 to 5.0 if you have four to nine on your system, and that'll go through a few things like make sure your machines are stopped helping you with migration, but that's experimental because we're not sure that we've kind of caught everything and we don't want to go through the 49 to 50 migration and, leave people in a bad state. So again, we're doing more testing on that trying to make sure we've got all the educes and we'll do the next release. Will default to 50 and promoting people to migrate from 4.9 to 50?\nTim deBoer: And it will feedback we've been getting solves a lot of problems performance, especially on Mac a huge improvements.\nTim deBoer: And that's all I had. If there's any questions. Speak up otherwise, Yeah, I see a hand.\nTom Sweeney: so clapping Yep.\nTim deBoer: that was a clap. Okay. All right.\nTom Sweeney: Which I concur with before you leave, could you drop a link to the blog post that she mentioned?\nTom Sweeney: And I'll go ahead and include that inside the notes. And thank you unless there's any other questions.\nTim deBoer: Okay. Thanks.\nTom Sweeney: All right. Steffen go ahead and take it away talking about a little lens.\nSteffen Roecker: Thank So I'm actually logged in twice with mac and Linux. So, let's see if that works. Yeah, so last year. Yeah, my background is basically I've been doing no machine learning since more than 10 years ago. He looks for 20 years. And as you all know, there's a lot of pass about llms. But as you look deeper at the used software everything it's a pain to set up. usually so I really found my love for containers since it makes a lot of things easier. And since I did it the hard way last year five months ago. I did a workshop at Red Hat developers hands one day.\nSteffen Roecker: And the hard way for me was using just using and it's all the examples as you might know. It's a bit tricky to get everything running including GPU support. So on my GitHub you can find the extra Workshop not the content itself. I think I still have to do that. But you can find all the instructions for deploying an llm with Putman. So the tool I used or the software Library I use is called ulama and some of you might know it as there's actual dock of people working on that. So Allama is basically the docker The Columns I've talked of machine learning models and why is that the case if you ever worked with a model, you can download the weight from sites like hugging phase. But same as for programs, you need additional software and settings. I can show you one example.\n00:10:00\nSteffen Roecker: You can also upload them to their Twitter website. It's basically like Putman or Docker push and then there's a few additional settings like a talker file or container file. You have a model file as you might know these models they have different parameters and mplate. I think this is very important that you get these kind of templates right if your work with this. So in the workshop, I've used it also because out of the box supported talker. But of course all the explanations and is only wrote how you can do that with Docker and the Putman it was a bit different so to show you The end result is basically a chatbot with retrieval augmented generation. I think that many of you might have heard that that's the bus at least a few months ago. So nowadays, it's quite easy to do there's enough software out of there.\nSteffen Roecker: But how to do that with Portman I think the most important thing when you start something you need to choose a image you can derive from and one common complaint. I've heard from my customers and people I talk to usually these software is not developed by software Engineers, like people like myself a different background and they just take a large. Container of a popular distribution right and put in everything then you have five or tens of gigabytes of things that the first thing I did. Is to create that container file.\nSteffen Roecker: Photographer that's one thing I was very curious as the dog talkifies the docker file and didn't pick up the container file, but it does if you put it in a command line, but It's nothing fancy, You take a universe a bit image for example from ratchet and then everything you do it just install the needed packages. So I'm using streamlined in that case and change the user and expose support. So I did before I did my container especially stationed. So that was the ultimate preparation. I would say as I learned a lot of things how to use and containers. Just creating this example. That's nothing fancy. But I think there's a huge demand of missing how to do that with containers. and what might be interesting for you as well as\nSteffen Roecker: Building it, right so I'm working on my Mac. Since that has inbuilt acceleration for these kinds of models. The Apple chip and the M1 chip but if you build on a Mac, I found out that you really also need to tell that you will Deploy on AMD 64 if you want to deploy it on the kubernetes cluster as usually you don't have mixed there. I think this is not needed but this is something that people new to Containers might need to be aware of and then also creating the network that you can talk to different services in Portland. I think you could actually Using something like compose, but I have not done that yet. So if anybody here wants to do that, feel free to open APR and then running it is super straightforward. unless\nSteffen Roecker: unless you work with tools or software like pytorch and I think this is a lot of pain for beginners and this is something I wanted to Deploying llms or machine learning models. There's a few things you need to know for example pie torch needs shared memory. And if you're not aware of that you might not be aware of this small line. I can make it larger here. Yeah, you need to set the shared memory size. So if you ever deployed pie torch, we are Putman or on kubernetes. I think this is one of the first things you run into high torch crashes because there's no shared memory. Usually in kubernetes, you mount an empty file with that kind of size to have it as well. So, like I said, I think there's still a few pit balls which are wanted to document for a beginner. As I count myself in there as well.\n00:15:00\nSteffen Roecker: And the other thing is of course taking this and deploying it to a kubernetes cluster, which I have also created yaml files as well. But then again if you do that and you don't have GPU support, it's going to be slow. So just switch to my different system. I can show you my screen there.\nSteffen Roecker: Books sharing you can see my screen, Perfect. Yeah, so on the floor and\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Yes.\nSteffen Roecker: I think it is not my Fedora system where actually do have it and media graphic cards. And I think one thing that I want to give back to the community is when I researched how to deploy a llm or any kind of problem software that needs a GPU. This is still a big pain, especially for beginners as you find a lot of how to's in tutorials out there, but most of them outdated. So what I can tell you the easiest thing that you can do is to use the Nvidia CDI\nSteffen Roecker: and not doing it with any Hooks and then you can actually trade for what just deploy your container using of course forwarding the port you later on use on your local machine somewhere else and then using device and media.com GPU or on the GPU and one important thing is of course, you need to disable. a bit of security in order to do that So this is not something that you really need to find out and digit deeper to find the security or playable disable that you get the most commonly Frameworks and everything to run using problem.\nSteffen Roecker: If I do that I can easily have to plot it on my local machine. So I downloaded Lama container which was built for Docker, but it runs quite well in Portland as well using this command line. And then I can easily query it. So I can pull you needed model if you don't have that. and I can look at my cheat sheet of\nSteffen Roecker: So this is also on GitHub where I documented. some of the commands needed creating the network or checking that you have DNS configured and everything in the network. to work with these kind of containers.\nSteffen Roecker: So one thing that I hope I can get out of this other presenting here to make it easier for beginners to use such kind of software and as you can see here, this is the streaming API of olama serving a large language model and Answering or completing the text. But yeah for the question, why is the sky blue which is one of the default things? That olama uses for testing.\nSteffen Roecker: Pretty nice and pretty fast. Thanks to GPU support and later on if you need. More complicated stuff. I think if you have mastered deploying models for inference, it was soon find out that these are not finished so you will need to find And fine-tuning them is the whole lot of other problems and actually found out using containers makes it much more easy. So going back to my Mac. I can share a few things there if you're interested.\nSteffen Roecker: why does it make it easier as you might know? There are packages for arm day for rocam and fedorano that it's very easy to run on a Linux machine. But unfortunately in media the coda libraries has still proprietary. So the most easy thing is use a ready-made container which includes all of it and you will see that most of them they use a certain operating system because it's also built in the way and media business. So we go back to my cheat sheet. Yeah, yeah. I have not prepared any slides or anything after these to educational apologize. But I hope you can learn to learn something from this.\nSteffen Roecker: as much cheat I put it On GitHub as well. If you did use fine tuning software, there's something called Oxford Axolotl. That's easy framework to get started. But in order to do that, you also need to know how to use it with pot man again. Using the the right security settings Mount your local directory that you can actually use the configurations Mount a volume for the hacking phase cache where model are downloaded and then use the right container. It usually use some kind of Nvidia supported Ubuntu operating system.\n00:20:00\nSteffen Roecker: But this is actually the only way I got certain software you need for fine-tuning and running these models faster because setting these up in your local directory without a container is really a big mess. and usually mess up your virtual ends so I can only recommend using containers to do that Unfortunately a few colleagues of mine they have picked it up. But just to show you why this is so complicated. I want to feature a bit of work done by my colleague Christian heims. He has created a container for one of his projects. and you can see he's using Fedora toolbox. That's something I really learned to love as it actually makes it quite easy and if you look at the container for\nSteffen Roecker: You can imagine why this is a pain to set up locally because you need so many different tools and then some of this is not packaged. You need to copy some header files. You need to download the right version supported for example for this is for Graphic cards. You need to download The Right versions. For the rebuild and this kind of stuff. I think this really showed me why we have containers and why this is a good choice for using this kind of containers for machine learning.\nSteffen Roecker: because I know I have spent a lot of time to make this happening on a local machine without containers but using containers and something like toolbox. Is really a godsend gift in my opinion.\nSteffen Roecker: This was basically the chests of it. So if you're interested in deploying it to kubernetes, it's also in my repository. Also how you can do this with GPU support. It's actually not much more complicated. there's a pre-made container image and then you just need to request some CPU memory and for example in Nvidia graphic cards, and my packages are on GitHub and also on cui not anymore apparently.\nSteffen Roecker: Yeah.\nTom Sweeney: That's not just look good. I wonder if quite something problems.\nSteffen Roecker: It does. Yeah, but there's a container here, but it's quite old. But yeah, I think what I would like the last thing I want to or to give back to the community. I think we need to document this more on document more example how especially beginners can get started. And I hope the amount of time and things I found out we can share with the community as well. So if you have any questions further than that. Please feel free to ask me.\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, I do have a quick question Steffen if you could share the link for your GitHub so I put more on some people can go ahead and dive in once they get that and put it I can keep it on YouTube as well.\nSteffen Roecker: Yeah. That's a good Yeah, and one thing which I wanted to add that I think the network thing is not working. I try to test it for our meeting but I couldn't get it to really work with the network. I think that's the last minute change. I edit a few months ago. But yeah in theory it works and on I have to say and kubernetes. It's a special shift. It's much more easier to set these things Even GPU operator than doing these things locally. So yeah, I still think using containers. Is good for this kind of work and people should use it more?\nTom Sweeney: and thank you for the link. I see that there. So does anybody have any questions for stuff on?\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, I am not hearing any. And I will thank Stephan was really nice presentation and Chuck and be interested to see how this grows over time. I'm sure it will. Nalin, we have you up next talking about podman manifest and the support for artifacts.\n00:25:00\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: Okay, just second while I get my screen Sharon going.\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: All right. I'm here to show you.\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: Okay, I'm here to discuss popular manifest and ocisful artifact support by way of background. Most of you are probably familiar at this point with using manifest lists the doctor format or they're related oci image index which is more or less the same thing to distribute multiple versions of a container image that have been built for different architectures. One of the things that we wanted to do with podman 50 and Brent could probably speak to this better than I do is distribute the disk images that pot and machine uses in the same place at the very same time as the container images that we're used to generate them and thankfully oci 1.1 as an ocean called artifacts which left us in bed. None can take items that are not containers in image indexes and distribute them through Registries exact same way. So we wanted to one of the things we did for Paul Man 5 and the associated version of Billa is add the ability to do that. So I'm just a quick rundown of the differences between the two first thankfully command like history. Remember some of this stuff for me. We'll look at the cont.\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: Image for BusyBox for example and in particular you see that it has a media type which says this is a noci image manifest. It has a config blob which would get the regular config blob. It's 372 bytes of Json. We're not going to look at that and things like environment variables the name of the command to launch by default pretty straightforward stuff. It contains. Well in this case just a one layer but each layer also has its own meaty type that tells you what it is. In this case. This one tells you it's essentially Giuseppe's carball, which is fine. We're not going to look at that one either. Those games also have things like artifacts. Sorry annotations attached to tell your additional information depending on who built it and what other information they wanted to provide in contrast that in artifact manifest looks very similar because I think the intent is to make it fairly easy for Registries that are already out there to add support for our artifacts, which is essentially just relaxing a set of restrictions they place on things that you push them. So let me inspect one that I've already got up there in the cloud, which is\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: this one you'll see that frequently you add something like an artifact type field which in addition to saying this is an oci image manifest index tells you what sort of artifact it is and this value here is just the default would be picked up from whereas which is we didn't actually know because nobody told us but we have to put something in here anyway, so that's fine. The config blob is actually just a lot if we actually embed the data for that config blot here. If you I'm day 64 to goodness. This is just a pair of curly braces. It's two bites and here is the interesting thing the layers, quotes are actually the files to be attacked in this case. This is when I generated from the Etsy Services while on my machine, it's 700k. We added in annotation to the layer that says, you might want to name the services instead of that big shot some if you're gonna store it in the file, but other than that, it looks pretty straightforward. You can slot this into an image index the same way that would it container image and then you can push it to a registry. So now I'll demonstrate that.\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: Greater manifest and caught in manifest help. We see that now has a number of additional options for artifacts. The main one that you want to use is Dash artifact it'll guess about the rest if you don't So we're gonna skip a bunch of these and I'll see. Yeah. you're sharing windows. Covering directly over the part where I'm typing so I can't actually see them doing it. Look at this.\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: But in the Manifest list, sorry image index gratitude and it's done. Let's use the Etsy protocols file.\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: Inspect We get a little bit more information than we used to in particular way to keep track of the fact that there's an artifact in here now and that's the file that we're using for it under the cover is probably and actually just kept a similar to this file. So if you change the doctor monitor of things are gonna go wrong it push time because the digest will no longer match. So don't do that. If you add things if you're wearing pod man, or what we actually have to upload a copy of file, so that's okay, but it takes up a little bit more gist space. So in case man the best push\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: today's date April 2nd\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: And hopefully quit that I was there we go. I'm sorry.\n00:30:00\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: We can't go ahead and inspect that list and put that to you. We can see that we have a regular image index. We keep track of the artifact type when we add one to an image index now and then we can actually just query clarifies. Not a word. We compare that manifest directly and take a look at what we've got now\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: but we just make it more legible. and as again, you can see this is pretty much better plate every single time. But now we've uploaded the contents of our protocols file, which is only 6K. And in a plan and machine image index you're going to Entries for multiple artifacts and you're going to see artifacts for different architectures different hypervisors. And those will also include the container which is that we're used to generate them, which I think is pretty slick. And it makes sure that when you're looking at it in the rest, you're always looking at versions that are synchronized with each other and they can't fall out of sync. That's something really horrible has happened and that's the entirety the demo and hopefully enough of background or that everyone knows what's going on those over here who might be wondering. Hey, can I create an image artifact for something and not put it in an image index that's not there yet. We didn't need it, but it's coming.\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: And that's the end of the demo. Have there any questions I'm going to stop sharing so I can see them on my screen. Unless there's something people want to take a look at before I stop doing that.\nTom Sweeney: And not seeing any.\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: Yeah.\nTom Sweeney: Go ahead.\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: that's me. Going to stop Got it not go ahead and ask the question. However No.\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, but I was hearing an echo. I thought it was somebody else's question in front of me. are there questions for nalin?\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: All right.\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: I should add that. this is something we actually completed about a month ago, maybe two months. So it's in the current version of podman and It's in the current version of pop in five and build was it one about 33 that work,\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: probably 135 that\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: so it would love to hear if you're running into problems or places where we can use the command line interface friendlier or more helpful. Right. Now we have a lot of these things filled in by defaults. If there are other things you can do to improve the user experience with us. I would love to get some feedback on that.\nTom Sweeney: All\u2026\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: All right.\nTom Sweeney: It's great. And that we have on one update.\nboston-video-enclave-3n292: we have\nMatt Heon: Okay, this is less of five and one update since we've already shipped it and more just a general release plan for the future. So we shipped 50. I want to say three weeks ago now two or three weeks and now we're starting to focus on stability releases four five. there were a number of problems with rules, which is to be expected. It was a major release and we're trying to get those fixed as we find them 501 was out yesterday that had most of the fixes for big things. We've identified still a few open large issues, but we're trying to get those sword especially once around pasta the new rootless network default.\nMatt Heon: let's see. So I'm expecting we will have probably a 502 maybe a 503 so some additional stability patches coming out over the next couple weeks for our next minor release. I would expect a pod man 5-1 sometime in the maytime frame probably the second half of May and that is going to be a much smaller release than 50 obviously don't really have any specific features plan. This is more of a let's get whose outset at some point early summer and then probably a five at some point in the later summertime frame maybe a July all this time frame.\nTom Sweeney: Just trying to catch up notes here. Are there any questions about that or comments?\n00:35:00\nTom Sweeney: I'm not hearing anything. thanks for that Matt. And given that we are out of plan topics for today and are there any open questions or topics that somebody else want to bring up?\nTom Sweeney: Take more thinking about that. I'll just remind everybody that the next community meeting will be on Tuesday, June 4th 11. Am again eastern time wutc five. I'm not at the moment and the next ball meeting will be coming up in two weeks from today on the 16th, and I'm always looking for topics for our either or both of those. And again, the cabal meaning is generally more of a design type of meeting things that you'd like to see added in the future. Whereas this community meeting is more of a demo to any questions comments\nTom Sweeney: see something in\nTom Sweeney: the chat\nTom Sweeney: I think rahil was making a note towards Steffen about them adding away to another container from Cube play Maybe add it annotation for that.\nSteffen Roecker: If you've read you to open a APR and I was looking at my contributions haven't touched it in a few months. So yeah, I'm happy for any hinder recommendation. And as I said, I was a Putman nuke before that. I still am so\nTom Sweeney: Right anything else for today? one last chance before I turn off the recording\nTom Sweeney: then I will thank the folks who presented today and check it was good talks all around him. Thanks y'all for attending and we'll see you next time.\nMeeting ended after 00:37:04 \ud83d\udc4b\n\n\n\n")),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"raw-google-meet-transcription"},"Raw Google Meet Transcription"),(0,Ne.kt)("pre",null,(0,Ne.kt)("code",{parentName:"pre"},"Tim deBoer\n11:03\u202fAM\nIf it's possible, I'd like to present in the first 30min\nSteffen Roecker\n11:03\u202fAM\nFine from my side\nTim deBoer\n11:11\u202fAM\nhttps://podman-desktop.io/blog\nSteffen Roecker\n11:26\u202fAM\nhttps://github.com/sroecker/LLM_AppDev-HandsOn/tree/main\nRahil Bhimjiani\n11:38\u202fAM\nAFAIK there is no way to \"init\" container from kube play yaml.

Currently we're gonna have vikascal goal talking about data production for appliance backup applications. And before we get into that I'm going to put in a quick word for devcon. oops gonna click my actual window that shine abstracts for that for call for papers is coming up next Monday. So if you're interested, please get those in and just confused itself is happening on August 14th and 16th in Boston, Mass us. hope to see a bunch of you there. And with that I'm going to stop presenting and hand it over to vikas.\nVikas Goel: Thanks, So I think I have explained the data protection of lines where it does flex Appliance in the previous. I think a month or two back. But I can give you a quick summary again and there are two or three different items. I wanted to talk about in the same context. So let's Appliance is a data protection Appliance. It's a multitenant Appliance. What that means is that again, it's a black box for our customers and we ship a physical Hardware. Appliance so customers can deploy the appliance. It's like a platform that supports continuous applications for our customers.\nVikas Goel: Is the container part is transparent. It doesn't matter whether it's container or running in a host or some of the form factor the appliance supports the backup application, which is again where it does proprietary. So we package the applications independently and there are multiple such applications. So we Veritas packages for Securities and sign them and the appance. Now that are different types of applications and different versions. So Appliance customers can choose to\nVikas Goel: upload their own type and deploy one or multiple instances of those applications at the same time and as I said is a multitagency is supported there's a lot of security and segregation in in terms of storage. All that is a ha Appliance as well. with that said one of the use cases of the data protection application itself, which is running in a containerized form factor. Is and these containers are running in non-produced mode by the way, very hardened and secure environment.\nVikas Goel: One of the use cases is accessing the fiber channel devices. And the fiber General devices for that matter, it could be let's say backup. Right. So ESX server is exposing. lungs for the devices as Target and the appliance works as an in initiator mode accessing those lungs. It's the zoning Etc is all customer configuration which ESX server which learns are connected to there can be multiple also for that matter. but again in the multi-tenancy context one instance of\nVikas Goel: a plan backup application can say I want to access port one? And another instance can say I want to access code too all the devices basically of Port one and the other one all the devices are portal that level of segregation can be done.\nVikas Goel: So when the platform starts the container applications at that time, whatever lens are available for a given code assigned to that instance. All of those lens are bind mounted or exported as Inside the container so that the application can access them. Now apply X the application itself doesn't have a ability to create devices inside the container. We have restricted that access the use of American audience Etc. So\nVikas Goel: when the container starts all the devices attached to the respective fiber channel code are exported to the container for backup purpose. now the VMware admin on the Fly change the devices number of lines can increase right more VMware more storage. The number of devices can change now on the host using you'd have and there is a schedule everybody Etc using that it can Auto detect the lungs. So on the host, you can see the lens any newly added lunch on the ESX server. To Appliance can detect it. However for us to make it available inside the container. The application container has to be restarted.\n00:05:00\nVikas Goel: Because at the moment, there is no way to say that. Okay, I have discovered but go and on the Fly make them available inside the container. So that's one problem statement where the challenge is that customers get annoyed. that's it, Your host can see but application is not able to. Use it because it can't say it and every time there is a change in the backend the VMware or ESX data store. It requires a restart of the application which downtime and planning and there's a lot of memory also warm up needed for the back of application to get started working functional. So there's some sort of frustration. So there's one thing I was looking for that how can we have the newly discovered devices\nVikas Goel: exported to a running container\nMatt Heon: so I am working on pod man update right now and I just came into something very similar where there is the potential we could have added new devices to The Container but I deliberately chose not to at that point largely because it's feels questionable to me whether we should be able to do this.\nMatt Heon: I mean our general answer to this would be if you can guarantee that all the devices are in the specific folder in slash Dev. You could Mount just that folder into the container and then you get changes within the folder IE devices being added and potentially removed without having to change the actual container config. and even here I should say the Pod made update case would have taken effect on container restart. There is no question that we can do this on a running container. I don't think we want to get to the territory of managing devices in a sense of pod man itself creating and removing them. That's the job of the OCR runtime the runtime only lets us update resource limits around time. It doesn't let us create and remove devices so\nVikas Goel: here so in the past in a different context not in the fiber channel, but Loop device context. Okay. Give me a second.\nVikas Goel: Sorry in a different context Loop devices. We were sort of doing something similar moving the Loop devices to folder.\nVikas Goel: And then rather than bind mounting the directory will still mounting the loop devices inside the container, but there was a challenge operating system itself that\nVikas Goel: when up any other system these service was getting restarted. It would nullify or make those invalid and redact support team suggested that we should not move the devices to directory. Let it be original location. and then we have to change this thing the way we were doing it, so if you can talk more about how we can.\n00:10:00\nVikas Goel: Solve this 5% that we uses moving to directory and without running to those kind of problems. I can look into that part for sure.\nNalin Dahyabhai: I'm impersonating nalin right now. Why couldn't you just have a process outside of the container that is monitoring say you live and then enter the container to add a device. One of the device shows up in the host.\nVikas Goel: and that's exactly what a mask or actually use the way we can do that. So as I said is able to detect any newly discovered so we can write another UW rule for that matter that there's a\nNalin Dahyabhai: Right if you'd have rule for. Your container then it could exactly as a privileged process and create the device inside of the container and don't think it could add a bind Mount so for ruthless containers, it probably wouldn't work. But for ruthful, I think you might be able to work.\nVikas Goel: so you're talking about the process running on the host or inside the container that can do it.\nNalin Dahyabhai: Which a process on the host that would enter the containers at least enter the mountain namespace to create the device. Maybe it does not enter the pin namespace. So the container wouldn't see it.\nVikas Goel: Okay using make node or something you're talking about, right? We have tried.\nNalin Dahyabhai: Correct.\nVikas Goel: that part also and I think somehow we felt that there was some challenges in that respect now. I need to go back and see that in worse than edues. It was a problem.\nVikas Goel: But there were some difficulties in that doing.\nNalin Dahyabhai: Yeah, we don't have it. I mean in a normal case podman's not even running at that point. So you have a little process card line that's waiting for exit code. So there's nothing running inside of the container. if you're running a privilege container, you can also do stuff like escaping from which is what I think toolbox is doing so toolbox is playing around a little bit in this area but they escaped the container and add devices on the Fly. But in this case I think now you have to be real careful with this because you're sticking your published process into the container that you have to make sure that you want to make sure that the container processes can get access to your privilege process. That's why I said potentially you just had to the mountain namespace and don't into the pit name space to correct the great advice.\nVikas Goel: \nVikas Goel: Yeah sure, I think. as I said I need to go back and see what the challenges with this approach. and not in ours anyway,\u2026\nNalin Dahyabhai: Yeah.\nVikas Goel: but there were scenarios when the devices were not getting were not usable after creating inside that but\nNalin Dahyabhai: Yeah, you'd have to make sure that they were created with correct as he's Linux labels and things like that. So yeah.\nVikas Goel: Yeah. when entering into name space, of course Dash Z option will help dear rate.\nNalin Dahyabhai: I know because the Pod man knows about the Dashie. That's but if you have issues with this probably and by the way, if you don't know, this is Dan Walsh, you can contact me and\u2026\nVikas Goel: Yeah.\nNalin Dahyabhai: I could tell you how to It basically you could just set the contacts based on the Parent Directory or\u2026\nVikas Goel: Sure.\nNalin Dahyabhai: something like that.\nVikas Goel: Okay, so we are still talking about. Exporting the devices directly not moving to a directory, right?\nNalin Dahyabhai: that's how you could do it without going to the directory one.\nVikas Goel: Yeah, because moving to directory was all sort of like we were doing and we had to revert that after moving to relate in real seven. It was working fine something and Change that was invalidating the devices. So\nVikas Goel: But we'll see that we'll get in touch then. Thanks.\nNalin Dahyabhai: Yeah, yeah contact me if you should contact me or at least point me to where the error is unrelated. With you creating a device because I could take a look at it and see if it's a permission things but use them rootful containers or this.\nVikas Goel: root for right now all the containers are Yeah,\u2026\nNalin Dahyabhai: Yeah, so fruitful we should be able to make it work without a problem.\nVikas Goel: okay. Okay. Sure.\nVikas Goel: So that topic I'll get back to you then. Yeah. Thanks. The other one somewhat similar is about but the volumes right that applications running with some specific volumes. And the customer says the user says that for this application. I want to increase the volume size by let's say 100 terabyte 200 terabyte. what that means is that internally platform will translate that size depending on the size new increase. Now it can create one or more new volumes. And would want to export them. Mount them in to the same application container\n00:15:00\nVikas Goel: Problem again today that anytime you want to add a new volume you have to restart right? Because the amount option is available only at the time of starting the container. So Similar problem is there with the new volumes getting mounted?\nNalin Dahyabhai: I mean you could do the same hack you can basically join the mountain namespace amount of File system I believe right?\nNalin Dahyabhai: Yes, between the money space you can manipulate that if you join the mountain namespace without joining their full container, then you should be able to mount. Although would you lose sight of the mountain hand space at that point? I mean if I join the mountain namespace, but I'm trying to join a creative directory and the host operating system. I join them on a space. I no longer see the only place it would be visible is inside the containerspace that would be on the hook. It would be visible on the Note. Yeah, and of course you have to be really promoting blocks.\nVikas Goel: Is this something? Can there be a rapper around, clean interface?\nVikas Goel: Which can do something similar. I'm looking for something in a supported fashion. Right that. but when we do something that is supported non doesn't go unsupported\nNalin Dahyabhai: I mean the supported way of doing this would be to use something like faster some kind of. System where you'd have a directory that you mount into the container and then your mouth these additional. volumes into that mile point\nNalin Dahyabhai: But by default we'll use an example. I create a container with a at slash inside of the container now later on I have and\u2026\nVikas Goel: Yeah.\nNalin Dahyabhai: it has another directory underneath that mount slash fool now if I mount onto that mount slash bar Then the container will see the new Mount point.\nVikas Goel: Yes again, this approach six years back when I started this Appliance. I thought of but there was a security problem. I think I found in that approach from inside the container you could delete or unmount some sort of thing. Again. It's been a while. I'm not able to recollect but there was some security problem. I found that was not viable option a mounting the Uber ory Parent Directory.\nVikas Goel: so that's why we didn't go with that approach.\nVikas Goel: But is there a challenge with the providing a\nVikas Goel: mount option the runtime when container is running and then you want to mount a volume.\nNalin Dahyabhai: I just don't know how I mean we would pretend we would run into the same problem that you're talking about. I mean all\nVikas Goel: No, I'm talking about directly mounting not Parent Directory. The way we mount it at the time of starting the container can there be an option to say that? But volume down to this container.\nNalin Dahyabhai: but\nNalin Dahyabhai: The way we start a containers we create a mountain namespace and then we start mounting into the different directories then we enter the mountain namespace. And from that point on we can't really Mount anything. after that From the bill and\u2026\nVikas Goel: Yeah.\nNalin Dahyabhai: not edit because we mounted over slash. So we're not going to see anything on the host at that point. Even if he had a privilege process inside the container won't be able to Stuff from the hose unless that was less the stuff from the host is mounted onto a volume that's already knotted into the container.\n00:20:00\nVikas Goel: But you just explain right that entering into name space again same mountain in space. A previous process can do it.\nNalin Dahyabhai: And I think once you enter the mountains say that the previous case we created a mountain namespace.\nNalin Dahyabhai: And then the final step is We basically switch process them. yeah, I'm out from one namespace into another could be tricky. Yeah, you want to buy Mount From the note's namespace and the containers namespace. this is something that I don't think example that right now. this\nPaul Holzinger: It should be possible With the new mod apis, you can first open amount and then join and mod namespace and then to the actual mount on FD stuff like that.\nNalin Dahyabhai: okay open up amount To a note and then hold it without I note.\nPaul Holzinger: yeah, something like that.\nNalin Dahyabhai: And we are talking really here though. Yeah that really.\nPaul Holzinger: Yeah. yeah, I don't know but in general I think this is really outside of the business of Portland because I run times through the mounting and\u2026\nNalin Dahyabhai: Yeah.\nPaul Holzinger: Currently, there's no way that oci runtimes update a running container with black mounts or something like that as Matt mentioned earlier. The only update is resource limits.\nNalin Dahyabhai: Yeah, so you would have to ride this through the oci if you wanted this to be supported by five, man.\nNalin Dahyabhai: Because we would have an issue. Obviously we used other types of Obviously. This would not work who was them? It wouldn't work with someone like he run VM or caught a containers things like that. So be very difficult for us to special cases. So I would say this is probably be best to be a tool outside about man.\nVikas Goel: You just talked about. having relate kernel having ability to do that. So is that some system calls?\nNalin Dahyabhai: Yeah, there's new system calls and I think they don't even know if they're in real nine, but probably in real nine and Beyond there's a syscall where you it basically open a file descriptor to a mountain. And then have that mount point then join the mountain namespace. So you're doing in two steps, rather than one step which currently I don't believe it would work. So if you have an open file descriptor that points to the previous Mountain namespace. Then you use it inside the new Mountain namespace.\nVikas Goel: \nVikas Goel: Is there a reason why it's not? implemented in\nVikas Goel: The container engine technology not just podman, but other if you consider Docker Etc.\nNalin Dahyabhai: I think it's brand new. I mean all it's within the last year. So that this feature showed up.\nVikas Goel: now I'm talking about just that mounting new volume inside the container itself that Docker apartment none of these support. Is there a reason behind that I was reading. very old Blog or some response on GitHub of yours then. Somebody had requested something similar where it's been four years. Maybe you're more.\nNalin Dahyabhai: Yeah.\nVikas Goel: And you mentioned that there could be some security issue with that if we Mounting a volume runtime when the container is running there could be some security issue. So\nNalin Dahyabhai: I mean you get the security issues would be if I leaked access to files from the host into the container. That's right. Just it'd be more about you have to be very careful when you do it.\nVikas Goel: Okay. So basically if you trust your Process is running on the operating system. or who is making the\nNalin Dahyabhai: Yeah, I would be more worried. I mean usually I consider what's happening inside of the container to be untrustworthy. So that's where I'm looking at. This is if you just add mounting directories in without careful, then the prices inside of the container might be able to gain access outside of the container.\nVikas Goel: but isn't it that same thing when you try to start a container with these? Volumes, isn't it the same problem?\nNalin Dahyabhai: Yes. Yes.\nNalin Dahyabhai: It's just your expanding the problem.\nVikas Goel: Just extending the problem. Yeah, I mean when your other we are doing the same thing right that either mounted running or\u2026\nNalin Dahyabhai: Yeah, yeah.\nVikas Goel: restart the container. To make it happen, but the previous process on the host that is making it happen.\n00:25:00\nNalin Dahyabhai: I mean, yes, you could if we built a totally at the Pod man then. We could do it To make sure that all the security functions line up the problem is if you do it out if you just inject something into the Container, then you're likely to hit things like using a space problems. I see Linux problems and potentially some of that issues. That's what I'm talking about.\nVikas Goel: Okay.\nNalin Dahyabhai: So you have to becomes your problem. If you want to inject a new mile Point into the Container you have to make sure it's labeled correctly and it's Fallout. It's inside of the correct username space.\nVikas Goel: Okay.\nVikas Goel: So relate the way Paul was suggesting really invalid. That is not possible Right.\nNalin Dahyabhai: Yeah, and really from pod man's point of view. I believe is complete There's not gonna be any more updates for relepod man. Is that right, Tom?\nVikas Goel: I'm just asking for that kernel ability that update.\nNalin Dahyabhai: but\nVikas Goel: Is that possible in relate or if you were to write our own custom some program that?\nNalin Dahyabhai: yeah, I don't know if that was ever backport to relate I would doubt it, but\nTom Sweeney: I don't think it was and the only updates were doing our critical bugs pretty much for real.\nNalin Dahyabhai: Yeah, but I'm talking about the code whether the colonel backpoint of the ability to. the new Mount API\nPaul Holzinger: yeah, I looked at this last year and then it wasn't the case and unlikely that it's now.\nNalin Dahyabhai: Yeah. I agree.\nTom Sweeney: Yeah. set\nVikas Goel: And line has it, right?\nNalin Dahyabhai: I would figure yes.\nVikas Goel: Okay.\nVikas Goel: Okay, that's a good info. I think. I'll go back and evaluate these options real line versus relate mounting going into the name space and those options. Let's see how it happens will come back.\nVikas Goel: the findings\nVikas Goel: Okay, thanks on that also and the third and last part is. Not a strictly tied to pod man, but more of like kernel plus but it is in the container context again that ice Kazi support.\nVikas Goel: There's no name space for ice crazy that you can create. So. You can't have multiple containers. manage their own eyes crazy devices directly running in container, right?\nVikas Goel: You need to have only one previous container which again? Is not something can be used in our environment. the data protection these applications For example nutanix, they expose the ice skating devices and they say that you want to backup overlays because that's preferred. for various reasons rather than NFS or other protocol, so\nNalin Dahyabhai: We rely obviously on buying out so Guys, cuz he would be happy we would prefer the ice cuz he'd be managed outside of the container in order to manage. I had something like ice goes inside the container. You probably gonna need capsuadmin which is pretty much going to give you control the system.\nVikas Goel: and it will be the similar problem like fiber channel I mentioned but I think you talked about over there that\nVikas Goel: previous process Eating the device inside. You will see that yeah.\nNalin Dahyabhai: the links kind of only allows you to know. a very small subset of file systems since without capsid and those are all the ones we allow on ruthless mode.\nNalin Dahyabhai: All right. Yeah, you can't even do NFS right now.\nVikas Goel: That Few years back. There was some principles committed\nGerry Seidman: Thanks for noting that then I do that was one of the things I was going to bring up at some point.\nVikas Goel: a while back. There was somebody from suse or somebody trying to make ice Cuisine namespace aware.\n00:30:00\nVikas Goel: but that didn't go in the Linux resource\nVikas Goel: the one to understand is there a challenge with making ice because he named space here. That's not there yet.\nNalin Dahyabhai: when they making a namespace aware. I'm not sure what they were trying to do. usually a remote API we're basically doing some kind of network storage if there's any enforcement on the server side. It's going to come in conflict with the username space. So that's the classic problem we have with Mounts that we might be able to use the namespace and the NFS Mount server side doesn't know about the user namespace, but other things that we want to make a namespace away. I'm not sure what else they would be looking at.\nVikas Goel: yeah, what I meant to say is that because it's Running inside containers and that can be multiple such containers. but they have their own network name space. So again, our networking is such a way that Every container is through maculan.\nNalin Dahyabhai: All good.\nVikas Goel: their independent they're not sharing any networking space any two containers. They don't share Network base. So they are totally independent isolated.\nVikas Goel: And these application containers can then what we want is that run their own eyes because they servers listening on their own network name is space.\nNalin Dahyabhai: Yeah, I think the problem there is is again that the is probably Colonel information being passed back and forth at the colonel Canon Sure isolation on\nVikas Goel: Right, right.\nVikas Goel: That's where I was talking about making it name spaceware because today it's easy as in the kernel namespace of you can't Run it in multiple Network container. Yeah.\nNalin Dahyabhai: yeah.\nVikas Goel: So the patch I saw for making it. Ability to containerize was pretty content. Not a lot But for whatever reason I don't know didn't merge into the open source.\nNalin Dahyabhai: Yeah, I would contact the developer and see if he has any comments on it.\nVikas Goel: Yeah, it's been four five years when I saw that that was Eden. But I thought it was also working on something From that comment or something?\nNalin Dahyabhai: Yeah, I wouldn't know about that. I would contact the red hat Carl system teams like Steven White House one of those guys and see if they have any comments on that.\nVikas Goel: And okay.\nVikas Goel: okay, I think those were the topics I had\nNalin Dahyabhai: Okay.\nTom Sweeney: Right great. Thanks vikas and\u2026\nVikas Goel: yeah.\nTom Sweeney: I think that is all the topics that we've had in advanced. Everybody have anything they'd like to ask about or talk about today.\nNalin Dahyabhai: I guess I had.\nNalin Dahyabhai: An issue that has come up that I want to make everybody aware of that. Running podman in emulation mode or podman commands or Scorpio commands to build a commands and emulation mode. Is not going to work. or anybody that attempts to run say pod man that are acute you use a static application doesn't work because nalin figured out that programs that reex itself use it acume you use a static screws up AG vizro. Ordinarily aggraves Arrow should point to the executable with exacting itself. And for some reason an emulation mode. the emulation puts RV one into the place about zero\nNalin Dahyabhai: so if anybody's ever tried to run a pod man build with a podman command inside of it on a different act than the native Arch, you're going to see weird errors there podman complaints about the second parameter and can't find in the case of when I was doing with Scorpio comes up and says can't exact slash or something. And so it's just something that a lot of people are now that they're on Max are attempting to run things in emulation mode when I'm system to an x86. So it's something that everybody should be aware of if you start seeing these types of issues. That's because they're running an emulation. I don't know how we can fix it. But it is what it is the emulate the whole BM. For you, yeah.\n00:35:00\nNalin Dahyabhai: But yet another reason to push back on people asking us to support you use a static.\nNalin Dahyabhai: It's great. But it does have some limitations. Yeah. it's kind of\nBrent Baude: Damn, aren't you the one asking us to support that? And does anyone else weirding out that the nalin's picture is speaking and\u2026\nNalin Dahyabhai: yes, I'm not asking.\nBrent Baude: Dan's voice is coming out.\nNalin Dahyabhai: Yeah, we're both in a conference room, but we got here late didn't side to hook up the conference system. We just hooked up nalin's already running talk if it makes it easy to pretend like Dan Walsh. Impression has flawless.\nBrent Baude: I like that better.\nNalin Dahyabhai: now it's been living here for a while so he could talk to Boston accent pretty well.\nTom Sweeney: e\nNalin Dahyabhai: That's on it Brent.\nBrent Baude: is the human user static thing is it declared as a bug and is it going to be tracked Upstream?\nNalin Dahyabhai: It's been track since 2020. This one was right about dashboard.\nBrent Baude: another one of those. Okay. Thank you.\nNalin Dahyabhai: Yeah. Other things like the multi-threaded the part where the program here emulating uses. Depends on call certain apis you can't call when you're multi-thread it because the emulator is usually compiled multi threaded that will fail too. really? Yeah, there's some quarter cases. they ran into is up is also I know you can't use any said your ID apps while you're in. yeah. So, there's quite a few. you can configure there's a lot of people pushing to use c** you use the stack but support it and as I've been playing with it. I'm finding it less and less. useful just because it's gonna blow up and weird ways that we're not a necessarily able to explain to the customer.\nNalin Dahyabhai: But they're going to come up more and more because people are on jumping on to Max.\nTom Sweeney: Yeah.\nTom Sweeney: Okay, any other topics are questions?\nTom Sweeney: just more we're thinking about that. I'm just go for the next meetings that we've got coming up our next meeting for the cabal meeting. We'll be on May 21st 2024 again at 11 am Eastern the GCC minus 5 at that point time and then our next community meeting will be a couple weeks after that on June 4th. Also a Tuesday at 11AM and that against Eastern Daily Time UTC minus five. one less call for topics questions announcements\nNalin Dahyabhai: And Tom the next time we do one of these we should probably try to get the Pod man boot C team to do a demo.\nTom Sweeney: Okay, I will add that's a possible topics.\nNalin Dahyabhai: Was anybody hasn't seen it? It's pretty impressive.\nTom Sweeney: And by yourself have any other possible topics for next time, let me know. Or Adam to our agendas.\nTom Sweeney: and with that I'm going to thank everybody for being here today and for the talks and I'm going to stop the recording.\nVikas Goel: Thank you guys.\nMeeting ended after 00:39:06 \ud83d\udc4b\n")))}Bs.isMDXComponent=!0;const Cs={},Ds="Podman Community Cabal Agenda Notes",Ps=[{value:"May 21, 2024 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-4)",id:"may-21-2024-1100-am-eastern-utc-4",level:2},{value:"Attendees",id:"attendees",level:3},{value:"Meeting Notes",id:"meeting-notes",level:3},{value:"May 21, 2024 Topics",id:"may-21-2024-topics",level:3},{value:"Open discussion - (0:22 in the video) -",id:"open-discussion---022-in-the-video--",level:4},{value:"Next Cabal Meeting: Tuesday, July 2, 2024, 11:00 a.m. EDT (UTC-5)",id:"next-cabal-meeting-tuesday-july-2-2024-1100-am-edt-utc-5",level:3},{value:"Possible Topics",id:"possible-topics",level:4},{value:"Next Community Meeting: Tuesday, June 4, 2024, 11:00 a.m. EDT (UTC-5)",id:"next-community-meeting-tuesday-june-4-2024-1100-am-edt-utc-5",level:3},{value:"Possible Topics:",id:"possible-topics-1",level:4},{value:"Raw Meeting Chat:",id:"raw-meeting-chat",level:3},{value:"Raw Google Meet Transcript",id:"raw-google-meet-transcript",level:3}],Ns={toc:Ps},xs="wrapper";function js(e){let{components:t,...n}=e;return(0,Ne.kt)(xs,(0,ce.Z)({},Ns,n,{components:t,mdxType:"MDXLayout"}),(0,Ne.kt)("h1",{id:"podman-community-cabal-agenda-notes"},"Podman Community Cabal Agenda Notes"),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"may-21-2024-1100-am-eastern-utc-4"},"May 21, 2024 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-4)"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"attendees"},"Attendees"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Ashley Cui, Christopher Evich, Ed Santiago Munoz, Gerry Seidman, Giuseppe Scrivano, Kevin Clevenger, Lokesh Mandvekar, Mario Loriedo, Miloslav Trmac, Nalin Dahyabhai, Neil Smith, Nicola Sella, Paul Holzinger, Tom Sweeney"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"meeting-notes"},"Meeting Notes"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Video ",(0,Ne.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://youtu.be/OC4_oCT1cdg"},"Recording")),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Meeting start 11:02 a.m. EDT (UTC-5) Tuesday, May 21, 2024"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"may-21-2024-topics"},"May 21, 2024 Topics"),(0,Ne.kt)("ol",null,(0,Ne.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Fedora Test days - Presenter was not able to attend.")),(0,Ne.kt)("h4",{id:"open-discussion---022-in-the-video--"},"Open discussion - (0:22 in the video) -"),(0,Ne.kt)("ol",null,(0,Ne.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Fedora Test days ",(0,Ne.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2024-05-23_Podman_5.1"},"https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2024-05-23_Podman_5.1")),(0,Ne.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Moving the Cabal to an every other month meeting, most likely odd months.

It's kind of how I like to fill in all the nooks and crannies of my day containerizing things some recent things that I have worked on with in red hat that I've become super excited about and I like to think spread throughout the company and kind of inspired new products and tools is Sig store.\nSally O'Malley: So I'm a SRE for the public good instance of Sig store for signing verifying can take container images and that's one thing over the last year we've read hat has a new product called trusted artifact signer, which is basically downstreaming Sig store and allowing people to spin up their own Stacks, which is very big stack of software. If you're using keyless signing another thing is open Telemetry. It will be in real nine five the Standalone collector and it's sort of sprinkled throughout Red Hat tools. It's a great tool for collecting data. and then the other thing is boot C. I love container.\n00:05:00\nSally O'Malley: Based operating system. I think that's what you call it image mode operating system. And so I've been working a lot with that over the past six months too. And then this AI lab recipes Tom and desktop. Yeah, I love extension. So. Yeah for years. We've had a great data science team org and within red hat and I'll get to that in a second and I never really knew what they did because it was AI, I don't know we'll get to it in a few years and I know I'm very good friends with some of the data scientists at conshoh Andrea, Michael Clifford and they work with Jupiter notebooks and Python and other stuff but about seven months ago it became apparent that\nSally O'Malley: AI is not just for data scientists anymore. It is definitely for application development and that is front and center in every conference every meeting every customer call. it's all about AI so we were kind of pushed together. The They know all the data science stuff. We application developers know how to deploy stuff and create containers. And so that is where AI lab comes in it kind of brings those two worlds together. And yeah, I'm gonna show it to you.\nSally O'Malley: So if you want, I don't know where this talk is gonna go. I'm gonna try to speed it up a little bit here. But if you want a more Scene great overview of generative AI development from local the production Cedric Clyburn is an amazing presenter and he just gave this I'm linking it in the slides which I will share as soon as this talk is over and I still a bunch of his thoughts. So there's that this one. So when we talk about AI we're talking about generative AI nowadays, which is with a natural language processing large language models. It's a subset that is where you get all of these things like text generation and code generation and image generation. So that's all called generative AI.\nSally O'Malley: so things like the GitHub pilot all of these every company, is spinning out there their ideas around generative AI but basically it's all the things that were going to be developing and making money with and all these specialized AI tools. Yeah, all the fun things like Chachi BT. whatever so\nSally O'Malley: where does this mean basically how do we get started AI development is really expensive. There's cloud cloud builds storage requirements.\nSally O'Malley: It requires the sun to run one of these huge large language models. so what we decided at Red Hat is a lot of this experimentation can be done locally and that is where podman AI lab comes in. So How do you get started?\nSally O'Malley: if you haven't seen it here is padman AI lab. And hold on. I want to make sure I'm not forgetting to say anything. I want to say.\nSally O'Malley: So yeah, it enables experimenting locally we all have pretty capable laptops these days, especially if you have a Macbook M2 or any laptop is capable of running powered applications locally. And I would probably lab. We just can show you how to do it without knowing a whole lot about Data science, sorry so there are recipes. I'm going to show you these in action but recipes. There are AI lab provides kind of vetted open source models with I should say open source licensed models.\n00:10:00\nSally O'Malley: And you can spin up a super cool just environment playground to try out different models and different parameters and let's check it out.\nSally O'Malley: So here I have my palm and desktop. if I go back to the slides here down at the end. Yes, the last slide will give you information about how to get started. If you don't know everyone on this call does but\nSally O'Malley: We go back up.\nSally O'Malley: So this is what it looks like. And I currently have pieman running. I think there's a later version. Matt will tell us in a little bit. And if I go down to the settings here, that's one way to find the extensions. That's how I usually do it. go to settings and I get a link to the extensions. And with the extensions there's a catalog. So podman AI lab is now featured in this catalog. I have already installed it if I haven't already installed it I would just kind of click here. I don't have many cubes install. I have a lot of these other ones installed. So I installed it great. Let's check it out. Here is the robotic seal down here that will bring you to AI lab.\nSally O'Malley: And like I said, there are recipes. So after I show you this I'm going to head over to the GitHub repo that backs these recipes to show you. if you're not a big fan of gooey's I can show you from the command line how to spin these up just as easy. So these are all natural Chatbot text summarizer code generation they work pretty well. And then there are a few others here and more will be added. Hopefully maybe someone on this call. We'll add a sample recipe to AI lab recipes that will find its way here.\nSally O'Malley: But these are all containerized they all run as a pot. So I will spend one up in a second, but I want to give you a little bit more of a tour. So here is very cool list of models that AI lab has gathered for you. So these all have open source licenses. You can also import your own model. So a big thing with AI development now is training kind smaller models to do specific things and I kind of think that's the way that the money making side of AI is going to go where we've got all these, specific models for different tools. And so you can train them and create them and import them here and\nSally O'Malley: With these models you can then the model isn't useful on its own you need to be able to serve it. And once you serve a model it's kind of like a file server you get an endpoint that you can then set up an inference. With so you can ask it questions and make it do what you wanted to do. So that would be there are two ways to kind of serve a model here with AI lab one is a Bare Bones just you spin up a thing called a model server. I can show you what's in it from the GitHub repo. But yeah. I'm not going to create it here now because I'd rather show you the playground. And is this already running? I hope so. Let's see. I'll start a new one. So I'm gonna hit new playground here and you can see I can choose any model.\nSally O'Malley: I believe. This one is already downloaded. somebody use this one and I'm gonna say\nSally O'Malley: I'm just called test create the playground. So what's happening is? A part of spinning up in the background with that model. Which is a Big Blob of data is probably like five gig four gig and a model server. And so you can do things like Define a system prompt.\nSally O'Malley: I don't know.\nSally O'Malley: Answer nicely. I don't know what to say. I didn't plan this. Good and then you can then?\n00:15:00\nSally O'Malley: Okay, whatever.\nSally O'Malley: I don't know what's going on. But let's go back to the other one.\nSally O'Malley: So last night I was playing around with it. And I said you are helpful assistant who always makes a joke with your responses I thought it would give me a joke. It didn't so let's just try it again.\nSally O'Malley: Can you tell me what podman is?\nSally O'Malley: What the heck? Sorry, of course, this is doing this. We'll try again.\nSally O'Malley: I'll check the pods in a second.\nSally O'Malley: spinning no model service is running great. Excellent. Let's look at the pods.\nSally O'Malley: There is no pad running. That is a problem. So let's try.\nSally O'Malley: I'm not gonna play with this too much longer. I think what I'll do is go on and then I'll come back to this maybe after at the end of the call figure out what was going on locally here and show it to you after but let's spin up a chatbot. That's a code generation.\nSally O'Malley: Great great first before I do that, I'm gonna stop any pods that I have running.\nSally O'Malley: No, I'm not because I'm gonna show you that.\nSally O'Malley: I don't know why he's telling me update this.\nSally O'Malley: Okay. Try again.\nSally O'Malley: \nSally O'Malley: I think what's happening is I have an old I need to clean out my local system. but hopefully it will push through and it is\nSally O'Malley: so what's happening here on the side is it is checking out the repository that I'm about to show you. and then it is downloading the model which is about four or five gig so you can see I thought it was gonna pull the same one that I already have downloaded. But whatever. It's almost done. And then it's going to spin up a model server container and a inference container which is the front end. So all of these natural language processing applications, they default to the Llama CPP. model server and the front end for all of our sample applications is streamlet. These are well known.\nSally O'Malley: well-known tools that everyone in that's currently playing around with AI is using\nSally O'Malley: Okay, It says it's running. So let me check the pods first just to make sure. So I see I want to show you this rag app that I have running locally from the CLI not from pond man. So that's why I didn't want to stop it. So it looks like you can go to the logs. you can see that the model is being served. Everything looks quite healthy. So that's good. And the cool thing is it gives you a cube yaml because that's how these sample applications are spun up. There's a model server container a mounted file. That is the model and the front end. So yeah, the apartment AI lab uses a local host path volume for the model.\nSally O'Malley: And on my local system, I can show you where it is when we get out of time and desktop so great. It looks like it's running so I can go over here. and open the app\nSally O'Malley: hopefully and what's happening here is that it's just not ready. This isn't an error. It's just gonna take a while. So what I'm going to do is show you the local application that is actually running. if I go over to AI lab recipes, which is here\n00:20:00\nSally O'Malley: This is the GitHub repository where all of the sample code lives. So if you had it's under containers and the recipes go to the recipes. We're using natural language processing today and I spun up this rag app, but there's a Code generation a chatbot a text summarizer. so I want to show the rag because it's kind of cool It gives you the option to drop in a file that has specific information that it will use on top of the model to answer your questions. So you can see that this is where companies are going to be using rag to and inject their domain specific information and create these chat Bots. They're gonna help their customers, whatever.\nSally O'Malley: So in order to play around with this from the command line, you can go to this repository and just run. There's some really convenient make commands. I don't have time to show them all here. But the one that you use if you just want to spin up something quickly locally would make quadlet. it does create the files necessary to spin up a systemd service. However, you can take just the yaml from the quadlet you can take the generator yaml file and just run it with padman Cube play. So let me I'm first going to show you what running and then I'll show it to you because it's already running so over Here I have.\nSally O'Malley: I did make quadlet and when I ran make quadlet.\nSally O'Malley: You can see I have the quadlight cube file which looks like this if you haven't seen it.\nSally O'Malley: Here is the cube spot the image file. So if you are running this as a system we service it would make sure that these three images exist before it starts failing. So There's the model containerized model image, which is basically a scratch image that just has the model file in it. There's a little bit more to it than that. And if I have time, I'll tell you about that and then there is this model server. So those are the three pieces of any AI app going today at least from comment AI lab and the AI lab recipes. It's A model server and a front end. There's also sometimes the vector database which kind of should be here. Maybe that's but we'll forgive it out later. So here's the unit file if you can interrupt me I can't see you so if anyone\nSally O'Malley: A question or want to interrupt me. Go ahead.\nSally O'Malley: Okay, and so here this quadlet file or the wrap around the systemd service. It's just going to run. I'm in Cube play this file. So now let's look at that file. And here it is it is and you did notice the automation around make quadlet. It just does it for you? So a lot of things in both Padma AI lab and AI lab recipes just makes it super easy for you to get started. Even if you have no idea what you're doing the data science I have a chatbot running. That's awesome. So here this is the annoying thing about. And I think padman has a plan for this but upstream and kubernetes. It's going to require a long. Kubernetes enhancement proposal which I opened a few weeks ago to make it so that you can volume out and image.\nSally O'Malley: Directly this and it container is necessary you needed I can't just have a scratch model image. I have to have a shell in there. Otherwise because I have to copy this file around which is wrong bad. But it's the only thing possible today. I think pieman is fixing it before Upstream cube is but anyways, that's where that and it container is and then here's the model server container the vector database which goes along with the rag app, which is retrieval augmented. Generation, which means you give it some info on top of what is the model so that it has some additional info and the front end. So that's all This is the pot. And what I did was podman Cube play.\n00:25:00\nSally O'Malley: The ragamo I didn't have to use the image of system D. It's just that and it's running. So that's what I want to show you and then we'll see if everything else is working. Here is my rag app. It's localhost:8501.\nSally O'Malley: And I started out by asking it. What is an ashoba Grizzly. My son plays youth hockey on the Nashoba Grizzly. So I was just curious to see what I said. It has knows nothing about hockey or nothing about the actual in the show, but Grizzlies as you can see, so I have a file here that is just an overview of the Nashoba youth hockey program. That's all it is. And I'm gonna add that to my rag application and now I'm going to ask again.\nSally O'Malley: and hopefully it will give me a better answer it did earlier it worked. If it doesn't it's your fault. No, it's because of maybe some bandwidth is being taken up by. Google meet I don't know.\nSally O'Malley: There we go. it says based on the context provided. And I could ask all sorts of questions about it.\nSally O'Malley: So you get the idea, it's fun. I'm doing this all locally.\nSally O'Malley: It's unfortunate that my AI lab is not working quite right and I am going to be very bummed if I get back and it's still not working, but I'm gonna have to show it again next month. That's all.\nSally O'Malley: So you can see very cool. All of the sample applications look like this is the streamlit UI they all look like this. There's the rag the chat the code Jan. So in fact, let's spin up another one. I'm going to stop this one now, and I'm going to go back to podman AI lab. So to stop it you would do parman pod stop. I'm just gonna stop them all.\nSally O'Malley: And go back to palmand desktop.\nTom Sweeney: one last go for\nSally O'Malley: Let's see if we have better luck.\nSally O'Malley: Okie doke I'm going to try a playground again. Maybe it just took time.\nSally O'Malley: Maybe not. Okay thinking kind of\nSally O'Malley: that's silly because I just stopped all of the Pod. So of course that's not going to work. I'm just gonna remove them.\nSally O'Malley: and I will\nSally O'Malley: start from scratch.\nSally O'Malley: model Services starting\nSally O'Malley: I think that it just doesn't like me today. And I don't want to take up the whole meeting. So I'm gonna go back to the slides.\nSally O'Malley: make sure I finished the\nSally O'Malley: what I wanted to show. I might as well try it. Never mind.\n00:30:00\nSally O'Malley: Yeah.\nSally O'Malley: So yeah, it's working and honestly there isn't usually not a problem. I'm not quite sure what was going on other than the demo gods. Have struck again. But here's the playground. All I did was You can choose different models. So if you're a developer and you're not quite sure which model you want to use you can go to the catalog here and choose one you can.\nSally O'Malley: I believe you can. Get more information about it. Yeah.\nSally O'Malley: we might as well try to code generation.\nSally O'Malley: Let me see if it's running now.\nSally O'Malley: All That looks good. That's the one I started before and I think it was just taking a little time. So, let's see if it's up and running. if I go over to\nSally O'Malley: Over here I should be able to see the front end.\nSally O'Malley: yay, things are working better so I can say How do I create a file server?\nSally O'Malley: and go it will give me the answer.\nSally O'Malley: It's so cool. you can run this locally. Just exactly\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Yeah.\nSally O'Malley: how I did it or make cubelet podman Cube play and you have your own personal little code Genesis and that is pretty damn good. It really is I use it all the time.\nSally O'Malley: So it's neat And then I'm going to go back to the slides now though because I know I'm taking up too much time.\nSally O'Malley: I will give you one more view of probably my desktop the\nSally O'Malley: the AI lab Overview recipe catalog I'll show you what's running. And you can just spin up a Bare Bones. Model server which spins up automatically with the playground. So that's why I have two running. This is just the information about the model server and look at this.\nDaniel Walsh: It's one of them.\nTom Sweeney: Ready? Thanks,\u2026\nSally O'Malley: I'm glad I didn't forget to show you this. You can it gives you.\nTom Sweeney: Are there any questions for Sally before we move on?\nSally O'Malley: code to kind of Embed this into a go application.\nTom Sweeney: holy miracle\nSally O'Malley: So yeah, it kind of tells you how to create your own AI app with whatever language you want. there now\nSally O'Malley: I told you about AI lab recipes. did I show you the code? I did.\nTom Sweeney: Looked up your back at some time in one of following meetings and\u2026\nSally O'Malley: these two blogs are Great about each thing alab extension and\u2026\nTom Sweeney: just to reiterated a little bit. There's a lot of red hat folks that are contributing here, but this isn't necessarily a red hat project.\nSally O'Malley: recipes and then check out these other resources\u2026\nTom Sweeney: It's an open source project.\nSally O'Malley: because there's ohlama and local AI to other projects that allow local AI development open source, and then I found this interview from Andre carpathy. I am I supposed to name wrong, but he was an open Ai and\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Hey any questions before we move on?\nSally O'Malley: Tesla gives a really great overview of where the industry is with regard to infrastructure and\u2026\nRick Wagner: Sally's slides somewhere so we can refer to them later.\nSally O'Malley: what types of applications are we developing and where are we going with AI so I want to make sure I include that and Yeah, I'll share them wherever Tom I'll put them in the dock, right?\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, if you can itself right into the heck MD links there with URLs or\u2026\nSally O'Malley: again, thank you to Cedric for Helping Okay.\nTom Sweeney: whatever or if you want to send me an email.\nSally O'Malley: With these slides helping me basically The public right?\nDaniel Walsh: Make sure the public.\nSally O'Malley: basically sharing them with me so that's all I have to switch them to public.\nTom Sweeney: Yes. Yeah,\u2026\nSally O'Malley: I can steal. I am going to come back to you all.\nTom Sweeney: make sure yeah, very good point make sure they're not red hat specific.\nSally O'Malley: \nTom Sweeney: Ready, so I'm gonna try flying on the edge a little bit.\nSally O'Malley: No.\nTom Sweeney: Sean Tanaka had given us a nice little demo for Rosetta and\u2026\nSally O'Malley: Hello. Yeah.\nTom Sweeney: pot man and hate it. And so I'm hoping that I can play it and\u2026\nSally O'Malley: stop presentation No,\u2026\nTom Sweeney: also share it with the video and\u2026\nSally O'Malley: I need to tell you that there are so many more things in AI lab recipes rather than these sample applications,\u2026\nTom Sweeney: everything. So we will try that and if you're not hearing the sound on this let me know.\nSally O'Malley: there's training and instruct lab embedding boot C images.\nTom Sweeney: Here we go.\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: Hello, everyone.\nSally O'Malley: So taking the systemd services and\u2026\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: in this video I will introduce Rosetta support in Pokemon.\n00:35:00\nSally O'Malley: embed them in an operating system image.\nDaniel Walsh: success\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: Past let me introduce myself.\nSally O'Malley: I don't have time to show any of that\u2026\nSally O'Malley: but next month, maybe we can show that.\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: My name is xion tanka,\u2026\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: and I am a solution architect at Red Hat in Japan.\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: It's in container technology. And I share information about Pokemon and openshift in Japanese. I am also the also of many blog posts and\u2026\nSally O'Malley: Yeah, please if you have any ideas or want to help maintain the AI lab recipes get repo it would be very much appreciated.\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: books. Additionally I conduct Pokemon handsome workshops webinars and community events in Japan. Do you know about Portman JP?\nDaniel Walsh: that was take\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: It's a social media account. I started to broadcast information about Pokemon in Japanese. Last year, I gave a presentation at the red hot event in this outfit. Pretty good, right? let's move on to the main topic. In Pokemon version 5.1. Rosetta support was introduced. These are all high performance x86 emulation on appreciating Max. Rosetta is enabled by default and can be disabled via the continent calf.\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: Hours and familiar with Rosetta. Let me give a brief introduction. Rosetta is Apples binary translation technology that provides compatibility between different processor architectures. There have been two versions of Rosetta released so far. The first version came out in 2006 and rotate to what released in 2020. Rose it to recently add support for the bachelorisation framework enabling the use of Rosetta on average VMS. We are targeting Rosetta 2 which we simply refer to as until Portman version 5.0 user mode animation using user static was available.\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: X86 64 emulation was also performed using this method. Pokemon machine comes with cable uses a dick installed by default put my version 5.1 and the radar you can use Rosetta for x86 emulation. Three important machine Rosetta can be used transparently a rowing users to easy achieve high performance emulation. The next topic is how to Rosetta require Gas podma machine version 5.1 orator So you will need to rebuild your Pokemon machine. I will explain the issue related to upgrading from version 5.0 machine rater.\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: First delete your existing polymer Then create and start a Portman machine using the portma version 5.1 CRI. If Rosetta is not installed on your Mac at this point. I'll pop up window will prompt you to install it. Please proceed with the installation. Alternatively, you can install Rosetta via the share ride beforehand.\nDaniel Walsh: Plus\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: Next once your pot my machine is running you can check the status of Rosetta. Use the Portman machine inspect command to check the flags.\nDaniel Walsh: That's something.\nDaniel Walsh: basically presentation\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: If you want to know more details, you can verify the Rosetta Mount inside the Potomac machine.\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: If you see Rosetta mounted at such Mount and registered in being fmt misc. Everything is set up correctly. In this case kimux8664 will not be present. let's look at how to run a container With the Pokemon run command, simply add the edge option to execute it. This method is same as emulation using user static.\nDaniel Walsh: might\nDaniel Walsh: It's not.\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: Additionally if you start the container with the touch option. You can check the processes with Pokemon top command. You can see that Rosetta is being used here. Next is building continent images. Long Pok\xe9mon build command with the platform option.\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: this method is the same as using user stick for emulation. And AMD 64 image will be created. Here is how to disable rosetta in case you prefer using First disable rosetta in the contest corn file by a dink Rosetta fors to 10 restart the Pokemon machine to disable Rosetta that rosette amount will be gone and qx8664 will be registered instead. When you run the Portman top command you will see Kimo x8664 in the process list. Now I will show you a demo.\n00:40:00\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: First let's review the Pokemon machine. This environment is for demo purposes. So I will delete it quickly. but if you want to keep your debt Please backup your images and volumes check the share a version. I have version 5.1.0 Create a Pokemon machine using the podma machine init command and start it with now option in this environment. The version 5.1 machine OS image is already downloaded. So it will be built from the cache. Normally about 900 megabytes of binaries will be downloaded from the internet. You can verify that Rosetta is enabled by learning podma machine expect command.\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: SSH into the polymer machine to check the rosette amount. It is correctly registered.\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: As expected qx86604 is not present.\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: exist the Portman machine\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: The first architecture is Now a container with the edge option.\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: The animation is working properly. Run another container and check the process status.\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: The bottom on top command shows that Rosetta is being used. Stop the container.\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: Next let's build an image. Using this container filed with the platform option.\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: When you check with Pokemon inspect command. You can see that and AMD 64 image has been created.\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: to describe Add Rosetta equal first to the content confile. Here I will uncomment the right to set the configuration. Restart the bottom machine.\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: When you run Pokemon machine inspect command, Rosetta is set to false.\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: Inside the Pokemon machine that rosette amount is gone.\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: And Cameo x8664 it registered instead. Finally, let's talk about now issues. How can users upgrade from Pokemon machine version 5.0 to version 5.1? The answer is there is no offshore procedure. An issue related to this has been opened. I commented on this explaining that the program is due to the missing difference. You are there. As a walk around. You can directly reference the volume 5.1 image using the Pokemon machine OSI command. This will Arrow the upgrade. However, this issue will require with each machine OS update. So we need to consider a fundamental solution.\n00:45:00\nTom Sweeney's Presentation: Another issue is that some container images cannot start using Rosetta? Certain features are not supported by Rosetta. as detailed in Apple's documentation Also, there are content images that cannot start with Rosetta. I will provide it samples of reported issues. it might be useful to correct reports on GitHub discussions or other platforms. This concludes my presentation. Thank you very much.\nTom Sweeney: All right, stop this showing.\nTom Sweeney: So look pretty good. I cannot answer any questions. However, I'm sure Sean would be more than happy to answer if you have some form and he was looking for any feedback that you might have. Good better indifference. So if you want to note it in the Notes or let me know real quick or contact him that all works.\nTom Sweeney: And give them that I am going to hand it over for our last day again.\nDaniel Walsh: yeah, one of the things I would like to see is how well a dnf update Works inside of one of those servers it's pretty bad in you use the static. so\nDaniel Walsh: basically downloading the processing of the huge XML file inside of RPM. Dnf, it's very difficult. If that works, that's a huge Improvement.\nTom Sweeney: Any I'll pass that along and see what he says. Yeah, unfortunately, it's like three o'clock in the morning his time in Japan right now. So not very good conducive to being here and talking with us. He wanted to just stay awake and I understand completely. Right Matt. We had one last topic for Bob man. I'm not sure if it was five o or five one one updates.\nMatt Heon: It'll be five one and five two. All\u2026\nTom Sweeney: go for\nMatt Heon: So we just released pod man. 5-1 last week. This is on the smaller side for our laces, but we're trying to a bit more quickly now, especially after the absolutely gigantic 50 rewrites. So we're going to do a couple of smaller leases this summer. I'm expecting five to will be out sometime in Late July for context. And what we put out in five one is a couple new features Rosetta as we just had a presentation on we made some Department update to improve its Docker compatibility. Otherwise just a varying assortment of small things adjustments to how we log health checks to reduce log spam on some systems. For example And a bunch of bug fixes the usual Betty there. I think it was about 20.\nMatt Heon: We're expecting a podman 511 this afternoon with some critical bug fixes for podman machine particularly on Windows Mac. And I'm expecting probably a couple more bug fixes in the five one series, maybe a five one two and two or three weeks after that and then we will move on to five two and hopefully a five three early fall though. We aren't quite planning that floor out right now. So yeah, that's about all I had on the future release schedule.\nTom Sweeney: Okay, anybody have any questions for Matt on?\nTom Sweeney: hurry But hearing that and given that we'll go into the open form part of the meeting if anybody has any questions on anything that they'd like to ask to anybody right now.\nTom Sweeney: or if you have any topics for future meeting much to see Sally\nSally O'Malley: Hi, I want to point out that we're gearing up for us Devcon CZ is next week. So maybe some people are going but deaf confuses at Boston University. Lots of great pod man talks. There's also an person containerization Guild on Wednesday August. I think that would be the between the 14th and 16th of August the Wednesday night at 5:30. There's an in-person containerization Guild you can sign up for I don't have the info for that with me. But anyways, if you are around Boston or feel like visiting Boston, it's a free conference. Check it out. I put a link in the slides that I shared with Tom.\n00:50:00\nTom Sweeney: Okay, do you recall the dates or\u2026\nSally O'Malley: It's in the sides.\nTom Sweeney: so dim the slides?\nSally O'Malley: It's August 14th to 16th. Boston University\nTom Sweeney: Really nice venue Boston years generally not too bad to take time.\nTom Sweeney: Right any other questions comments talks?\nTom Sweeney: I'll just share one last thing we've decided department cabal meetings have been lightly attended as of late and we have been doing them now in Kings of every month on the third Thursday of the month. So what we've decided to do instead is to move them to the first Tuesday of the month of odd number months. So we'll be doing the community meetings which were more demo based like this one today on even number months. And then on the odd number months, we'll be doing the ball meetings, which is more of a technical discussions over things that could or should change within Paul man or design things.\nCedric Clyburn: Hey, yeah,\u2026\nTom Sweeney: So the next one for that will be on July 2nd coming up in three or\u2026\nCedric Clyburn: I just wanted to say I'm helping Dan with a cool new show that I just want to give a quick shout out for\u2026\nTom Sweeney: four weeks. Although giving that's right before the holiday. There's a chance that I might cancel that one as I personally can't be there in somebody else will have to run it and\u2026\nCedric Clyburn: where he's gonna be talking about a lot of cool topics with pod man containers.\nTom Sweeney: then our next community meeting will be on August 6.\nCedric Clyburn: There's some episodes we're gonna be dropping tomorrow on the red hat developer YouTube channel and\u2026\nTom Sweeney: And with all that and Sally just back their mind August 6\u2026\nCedric Clyburn: we'll make announcement on the Pod Man YouTube channel,\u2026\nTom Sweeney: if that's looks like a good time frame for\u2026\nCedric Clyburn: but it's a cool Vlog video series super short five to ten minutes and\u2026\nTom Sweeney: That would love to have you back for that and Cedric you have your hand up.\nCedric Clyburn: I'm super excited to be a part of it. We kind of talked about this doing Summit and I'm glad it's already coming to be like a real project that we're about to lunch. So, stay tuned for that. It's gonna be really technical deep Dives with some guests and very excited for it. So that's my little update.\nCedric Clyburn: tomorrow morning 9 am ET\nCedric Clyburn: Yes, will do.\nSally O'Malley: Is it a live stream or is it a recorded cool\nDaniel Walsh: recorded\nTom Sweeney: When the first one is dropping officially. or\nTom Sweeney: Okay, could you get me a link for that, add it to the notes. Right. Thank you smart.\nTom Sweeney: That sounds great. Looking forward to it.\nTom Sweeney: So let's call for close up here. You Bill said anything. Right that I will stop the recording and thank you all for coming today.\n")))}Os.isMDXComponent=!0;const Gs={},Ys="Podman Community Cabal Agenda",Fs=[{value:"Jul 2, 2024 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-4)",id:"jul-2-2024-1100-am-eastern-utc-4",level:2},{value:"Attendees",id:"attendees",level:3},{value:"Meeting Notes",id:"meeting-notes",level:3},{value:"Topics",id:"topics",level:3},{value:"Konflux for upstream Podman/Buildah/Skopeo images and CI w/ Ralph Bean, Sumantro Mukherjee, Chris Evich - (0:45 in the video)",id:"konflux-for-upstream-podmanbuildahskopeo-images-and-ci-w-ralph-bean-sumantro-mukherjee-chris-evich---045-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Community Interaction - bridging (IRC, Discord, Matrix), channels.

This is the podman community meeting. Today is Tuesday, August 6. And this meeting happens on the first Tuesday of even number of months. We will try to make the timing every now and then friendlier for India, Australia. topics are driven from meeting requests or Emails to me so however works best for you. I've put the agenda up in the Google Chat for the room. So if you want to get in there go ahead and take a look there for what we're going to have for products today. And generally we have discussions for Paw man build a Scorpio and related container projects. So if you have anything related to those Technologies, we have to have it. Are meeting notes or noted here as well? and then for today\nTom Sweeney: we have topics of pop in 5 too from Matt hand and then Paul's going to give us a quick little demo for probably an artic artwork DNS TCP update and then eel data discussions from Anders. I did have a couple other things lined up today, but had to have the folks who are going to present unfortunately had it back out, but they will be here for months. and for the October meeting And I think that's got all I have I will be taking notes on the hack MD if I mistype anything or special if you have any links or additions to that. I appreciate you go ahead and add them to the fact MD as well. And with all that I'm going to stop sharing and I will hand it over to Matt.\nMatt Heon: Okay, so I'm gonna do a brief discussion of odd Man 5 2 which just came out last week five two is been a relatively quiet release another one after five one. So we had a very big breaking change release with five other. We're starting to be a little calmer after that be a little more measured but also we have a lot of people inside the podman team working on CI refactory and general fixes to our development processes, which is traditionally amount of time. We're spending working on directly at least until that's done. What one of the things that did spawn was a lot of flake fixes? We have a lot of race conditions inside podman that got resolved in this last release and a lot of just other bugs got fixed as well. But feature wise we had lip K Roots support merged. This is a pretty big one for podman on Mac because it lets you create VMS with gpus mounted into them.\nMatt Heon: And we also fixes Fair upper partitions to Quality so quad that's really getting good at this point. It feels like effort at least we get closer to support the entire apartment. Following that I decent number of non-breaking changes couple Flags had their meet exact meetings tweets things of that nature. So on the whole relatively common release and I am expecting at least one more release this year probably in the octoberish time frame and potentially another one after that. We'll see.\nMatt Heon: And that's about all I have.\nTom Sweeney: Yes, I'm for the five two. We're expecting a z or two release of the next few weeks months.\nMatt Heon: I am hoping that we're going to get a five to one out next week with a variety of bug fixes that have been accumulating that didn't quite make it in time. five to two little far on the horizon to predict what I do think we will have one just don't really know when\nTom Sweeney: But they're great.\nTom Sweeney: Thank you. Any questions on any of that for Matt?\nTom Sweeney: Okay.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Namaste there was a question in the shaft about the new car another Mount feature requirements. asking for clarification if it was back for the red or something. not\nMatt Heon: I do know it should be in all rails for delivering. We haven't had any problems like weighing it.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: I think it really they were just requesting that to be mentioned next to the kernel version number or something.\nTom Sweeney: What's happened?\nTom Sweeney: Okay.\nTom Sweeney: I didn't know if it was a discussion and GitHub. That I've missed.\nPaul Holzinger: I answered that but it was backpointed into relate so should be working I guess but we are no longer shipping Department updates as well like Portland five updates, so We don't test it.\n00:05:00\nTom Sweeney: So at this point, I think I'll hand it over to Paul since he's got the screen already talked about artwork DNS and gcp.\nPaul Holzinger: So in case you don't know, what DNS is and how about DNS is our custom DNS server that is there to resolve container names between containers on the same network. So if you have to contain one of the name container one and container to then you can Do a DNS look up on the name and get the IP of the other container in order to? communicate between them so far this was only done so DNS is mainly UDP protocol. But it also works via TCP, which is near the different phase of larger DNS messages you need to send because you're the packages size Unlimited.\nPaul Holzinger: The protocol only lost for so much information. So in this case all modern clients will transparently fall back to switch over to TCP. And you said And anarak DNS so far couldn't handle that that is now fixed in. What's the version 1.12? Arabic DNS 1.12 and that about 1.12. So if you have this versions We can now first create a network. And where we have DNS enabled by default. So just call it in one.\nPaul Holzinger: just Through interactively and there are greater the Fedora base image with a dick installed already, which is just our image, but I have dig so we can just do a public. and look up and if you look in ATC results.com So this is the network Gateway IP. Where are DNS if running on the host, so\nPaul Holzinger: show\nPaul Holzinger: Sorry, we now see automatic DNS process running. And it's running to networks because I also had another container already running from testing. I guess left it running. And so yeah, you see it's binding unipe. It's binding the TCP socket and if you know nothing again, you see at the bottom. It's using UDP by default because it's a small request but if you try to request something larger like some domains if a lot of Txt records that will create a bigger response. The related.com domain as an example. see at the bottom. It's automatically using TCP and see it's like a larger payload the message size here.\nPaul Holzinger: And previously this wouldn't work. so, if you had Crazy large records. Yeah, you're usually don't see this with and what a records because Yeah, some limited IP only but it's like txt records or I don't know some SRE or whatever records you might request day that you might see that.\nPaul Holzinger: And yeah, I think I can show one other thing\nPaul Holzinger: just\nPaul Holzinger: so one other thing I fixed so there was a problem previous and previous versions if you if you're already having DNS on part 53 running, right?\nPaul Holzinger: on all addresses then you would. That's why I think if it's still on it, so No problem. Of course, if you don't test properly that that's what happens. Yeah. so just as an example, so I have to put already Bond and now it should. Get a new era. Which tells us that anarchiness is not running and previously it was just ignored. which was very confusing and led to some Upstream issues where users were wondering why they are DNS isn't working and it was because it was already some other dinosaur listening on the port.\n00:10:00\nPaul Holzinger: and yeah, I think it's pretty much everything you can say about that.\nPaul Holzinger: any questions\nPaul Holzinger: Yes, they were independently like you can update only the American dollar back if you like to but yeah. it's\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, and plans for further back. So it'll be five two and above.\nPaul Holzinger: yeah, it was a large refactor. So there's no way we are going to beg for this. realistically, so\nTom Sweeney: Great. Yeah.\nPaul Holzinger: 112 and off\nTom Sweeney: Any other questions for Paul?\nTom Sweeney: Right. Thanks Paul. I will now turn it over to Anders for the young discussion on statements about you all e o l l to and I cannot get that out under so I hope you do a better job with it and I did.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah. Yeah We can go with end of life instead. It's for you.\nTom Sweeney: Okay, it's easier.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah, there is a website called end of life. Which has taken upon itself together and of life date so various products and it also includes some of the open source project. So there was a page for doctor and in that is the mobish server.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: And then there was a request to do a similar page for the podman engine. I mean for the Linux based server software, so I did such a page by your Gathering and release dates and then there was a question about which release Cycles are end of life which are still supported. so we have some discussion on that so I think we landed upon that Upstream. The latest release is supported So currently five two. And the others are not supported Upstream, but they are supported in Fedora but those have individual product pages on this website. So they are not listed under the apartment.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Then there was some. recommendations from Upstream that you should State this on the website somewhere What users can expect? if you are following semantic versioning and how long I release is supported for if there are now LDS releases.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: and then again that I posted a link to the preview of the prmade which is basically a demo file with dates. And then also a small graphic visualization of the same place.\nMatt Heon: So I'm still a little unclear is the ask that we set an EOL date when we create the release or that we keep a consistent list of EOL dates when the release actually eols.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: so currently it's just UL colon but they were saying it was more of interest for the end users if they would know just how out of date there are three four deployments. I'm not sure if that relevant actually but It was just a website presentation thing. So now it's just a green or red color. There are no dates on when it stopped being updated because you couldn't really automate this from the git tag. So the GitHub releases. Because 4.8 grows silent fairly quickly, but for about nine continues to get releases after 5.0 series out. So there is a small overlap when the major version is out. So that's\n00:15:00\nMatt Heon: We've never formalized a policy on that, but it would not be a bad idea on our part to do so,\u2026\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: no.\nMatt Heon: especially considering. It usually for us is going to go around Fedora releases. Honestly, like we will we are obligated to keep the previous minor release around\u2026\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah.\nMatt Heon: until the Fedora released associated with it dies so we can actually Paul I think we could set eols based on that with your\nMatt Heon: I wonder if we could say that we guarantee at least two months of support for every minor release. So five two is guaranteed to be supported August and September and then we could extend that support necessary if we're going to do say in October five three, but I don't think we've ever done minor releases on a short Cadence then two months.\nTom Sweeney: And when you're thinking minor release you're thinking and XY release.\nMatt Heon: Yeah, X y z support is we supported until the next xyc comes out and you're expected to immediately update XYZ or purebug fixed releases. If you're not keeping up stay on the bug fix releases, I can't do much for you.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah, I think they call them that's releases in the December lingo. the digit I mean But it's really up to the project to Define these things.\nMatt Heon: Yeah, sorry.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: This website will have to gather information and link to it. I used the git tags, but then I noticed it's actually using the GitHub releases to some of the dates were off by one but it's more or less the thing.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: especially with the earlier releases that could be a couple of days before the GitHub release was in order after it was tagged because the CIA was not super but nowadays it's more or less the same day usually Then there was another discussion on when the server is available. when it's your Portman machine version updated, but I don't think we will go on this website, but that's a source of confusion for some music.\nMatt Heon: That is mostly salt at this point. Now that we've moved over to oci artifact-based distribution. We're building those same day. We make sure we have the resources on the team available to get the appropriate images out same day. And we're also moving toward a process\u2026\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Yeah.\nMatt Heon: where it'll be completely automated right now. It's manual intervention to get the images built.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: and of course, the user was asking about the windows WSL image, which the only one that does not follow because it's using fedora.\nMatt Heon: that is also we're looking into whether we can fix that.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: biological close enough\nMatt Heon: Yeah, yeah,\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: and then in podman desktop, it will show you the client version. even And then you think you're updated and you're wondering why the bugs won't fix them. So there's some. minor things that's to\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: that was basically just wanted to share this image. Hopefully it will be much drain when will be available on the normal site and then there is a Automation in place. So whenever you make a new GitHub release, it will update them the patch versions and when the five three is out then someone has to make a PR to add the new release. I can to the web page.\n00:20:00\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Same goes if you want to add them a text for certain releases are supported for longer in a certain distribution stuff like that. Right now it just says that the Upstream product is supported by the containers community and there is no support contracts from this community.\nMatt Heon: This is something I would like to get more clarity into our readme. I don't know what kind of a formal policy we can evolve here. But I feel like it would be nice to have more clarity for the community as to how long they can expect through eases to live.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: yeah, and\nMatt Heon: I know Paul is immediately going to say we don't plan that far in advance, but I think we can make certain guarantees really make a\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: Recommendation from the Upstream is that you put the information on the website because if you put it in a repository, then you might upload it end up with the situation where you have different policies for different branches. So, the current documentation when you make a fixed a monster and then someone is wondering why it doesn't apply to the release and so on so it's probably better to do these things on podman.io and then you can update them. whenever\nMatt Heon: They understood.\nTom Sweeney: Trying to take notes and talk at the same time just work. so it's there any further action that we should do for this for now.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: I don't. Know also for Paul I changed the title from Portman and into pod man on popular requests. I don't know. And then the same day someone was posting the immediate release of podman 1.12 and I was like, yeah now it's starting but it's partman desktop. Yeah.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: and that's all I had so he can open it up for other discussions.\nTom Sweeney: but you said\nMatt Heon: Tom you're break\nJhon Honce: Tom's Video is stopped moving for me.\nMatt Heon: Yeah, I think Tom may have dropped. Tom can you hear us?\nTom Sweeney: But are getting through.\nMatt Heon: Okay, we can hear you. Tom your network is\nTom Sweeney: Yes, I love my ISP at times. That was not one of those times. I didn't quite hear what Anders said at the end there. I don't know if we have any further discussion if we should move on at this point.\nMatt Heon: I think we're going to move on.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: And yeah,\u2026\nMatt Heon: Sorry, man.\nAnders F Bj\xf6rklund: that's what I said move on.\nTom Sweeney: Okay, we'll move on which leads us only with any open Forum or Anybody have any questions or comments or ask that they want to do here now?\nTom Sweeney: very quiet I'll let you all think real quick about that and I'll just go over what's coming up next. So our next community meeting is on October 1st, 2024. We're doing again the community meetings on even numbered months on the first Tuesday of the month our next cabal meeting. It's not July 2nd as I have it in the notes that must be September.\nTom Sweeney: September 1st Right after Labor Day for a bunch of us here in the US. So that'll be our next cabal meeting. I'll fix that up in the notes. Again. That one is on odd number months that we were doing that in the first Tuesday of the month for the next community meeting. We're going to have those who demonstration Brent or Matt. Let me know if I'm just announcing that from Devon Stein and then Okay,\u2026\nBrent Baude: Yeah, I don't know how it's pronounced.\n00:25:00\nTom Sweeney: u looks interesting. So they'll be a good little topic for us and then cellular who is here last time with us and had hoped to be here today but called away because she's getting ready for Deaf coffee us. If you're not hooked up with that give that a look up The Confident us happening in Boston on August 15th. I think just right around the corner. Anyway, she's going to be doing an AI lab demo with GPU pass through.\nTom Sweeney: On the next community meeting. So with all that I'm going to give questions one last topics I'm not hearing anything. Given that I will thank the presenters and we'll just stop the recording them. So, thanks all.\nMeeting ended after 00:25:56\n")))}_s.isMDXComponent=!0;const Xs={},$s="Podman Community Cabal Agenda",er=[{value:"Sep 3, 2024 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-4)",id:"sep-3-2024-1100-am-eastern-utc-4",level:2},{value:"Attendees",id:"attendees",level:3},{value:"September 3, 2024 Topics",id:"september-3-2024-topics",level:3},{value:"Meeting Notes",id:"meeting-notes",level:3},{value:"Close old issues after &quot;X&quot; amount of time on GitHub - Matt Heon - (0:32 in the video)",id:"close-old-issues-after-x-amount-of-time-on-github---matt-heon---032-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Allow using a <code>ssh:</code> host directly, without having to create a system connection or setting up a unix domain socket tunnel - Anders Bj\xf6rklund",id:"allow-using-a-ssh-host-directly-without-having-to-create-a-system-connection-or-setting-up-a-unix-domain-socket-tunnel---anders-bj\xf6rklund",level:4},{value:"Open discussion - (31:41 in the video) -",id:"open-discussion---3141-in-the-video--",level:4},{value:"Next Cabal Meeting: Tuesday, November 5, 2024, 11:00 a.m. EDT (UTC-5)",id:"next-cabal-meeting-tuesday-november-5-2024-1100-am-edt-utc-5",level:3},{value:"Possible Topics",id:"possible-topics",level:4},{value:"Next Community Meeting: Tuesday, October 1, 2024, 11:00 a.m. EDT (UTC-4)",id:"next-community-meeting-tuesday-october-1-2024-1100-am-edt-utc-4",level:3},{value:"Possible Topics:",id:"possible-topics-1",level:4},{value:"Raw Meeting Chat:",id:"raw-meeting-chat",level:3},{value:"Raw Google Meet Transcript",id:"raw-google-meet-transcript",level:3}],tr={toc:er},nr="wrapper";function ar(e){let{components:t,...n}=e;return(0,Ne.kt)(nr,(0,ce.Z)({},tr,n,{components:t,mdxType:"MDXLayout"}),(0,Ne.kt)("h1",{id:"podman-community-cabal-agenda"},"Podman Community Cabal Agenda"),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"sep-3-2024-1100-am-eastern-utc-4"},"Sep 3, 2024 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-4)"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"attendees"},"Attendees"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Anders, Daniel Walsh, Ed Santiago Munoz, Gerry Seidman, Giuseppe Scrivano, Jan Rodak, Jhon Honce, Kevin Clevenger, Lokesh Mandvekar, Mario Loriedo, Matt Heon, Miloslav Trmac, Mohan Boddu, Nalin Dahyabhai, Paul Holzinger, Rick Wagner, Tom Sweeney"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"september-3-2024-topics"},"September 3, 2024 Topics"),(0,Ne.kt)("ol",null,(0,Ne.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},'Close old issues after "X" amount of time on GitHub - Matt Heon ',(0,Ne.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RUN/issues/RUN-1722?filter=allopenissues"},"jira 1722")),(0,Ne.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Allow using a ",(0,Ne.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"ssh:")," host directly, without having to create a system connection or setting up a unix domain socket tunnel - Anders Bj\xf6rklund (podman #23831, #21113, #17452)")),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"meeting-notes"},"Meeting Notes"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Video ",(0,Ne.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_QR2hbXHH4"},"Recording")),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Meeting start 11:03 a.m. EDT (UTC-4) Tuesday, September 3, 2024"),(0,Ne.kt)("h4",{id:"close-old-issues-after-x-amount-of-time-on-github---matt-heon---032-in-the-video"},'Close old issues after "X" amount of time on GitHub - Matt Heon - (0:32 in the video)'),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"The number of issues in GitHub on the Podman repository is growing \u2014currently over 600.

We have just a couple topics on the agenda today. First one is whether or not we should close all the shoes, after some amount of time on GitHub and then wonders and not really leading that one. And Anders will be talking about using a SSH host directly without having to create a system connection or setting up a UNIX domain socket tunnel. And all with all that I am going to hand it over to Matt, take it away, Matt.\nMatt Heon: So I was not the one who was supposed to be heading handling, This is on PTO, but I will do my best to drive it through. So, basic intent of this discussion. We are, actually got a real number for this.\nMatt Heon: So we have last eight text a lot of issues open on odd, man, and it's an ever-increasing number. The number is presently over 600. Several years ago, we said that we were going to make serious efforts to keep the number under 200 and that proved to be very not viable. And the number has been steadily increasing ever since So, we have a request to try and take that 600 number down, at least somewhat and they have two potential proposals. And how to do this. One is declare issue, bankruptcy, we close everything and then we let people reopen, what they feel is still relevant.\nMatt Heon: Two, we influence some sort of timed closure policy on existing issues such that if a bug, has no activity from any party for let's say 90 days, we automatically close it and that keeps the numbers tidy. again, this is just a numbers thing, it doesn't actually fix the bugs. It just makes circuit help look tired here. And I know that we have people in this call with strong opinions about that. Including Ed who I believe created a document on how we were supposed to handle these issues ago. So Ed, any thoughts on this?\nMatt Heon: I would love to do that, but At the moment, I have had two people leave the team and they're going to be replaced, but down on horsepower as opposed up on horsepower. And I don't see that changing for at least next three months. So I would be looking for regardless of that. Also, there are bugs that just end up being opened and then left and nobody really ends up closing them, because the book just sort of Peters out people stop responding and it just kind of sits there. So I can see value to an auto close functionality.\nPaul Holzinger: so I'm not really fond of all the closing and general because right now we are not keeping up at all on upstream and if a bug hasn't been trashed and classed that I don't know how to say, That's just disrespectful to the reporter. Nobody looks at the box says, there hasn't been any activity, I closed it I understand. that there are a bunch of issues and in there that are longer care. but I would say, that's probably still a minority. the other set of issues are either valid feature requests that are nice but we don't prioritize or\nPaul Holzinger: On normal bucks. We also don't prioritize so doesn't make them go away. And if to go anders to have a shiny number then I don't think having a shiny number is the fire. But\n00:05:00\nMohan Boddu: I would like to go last,\u2026\nMatt Heon: Mohan. Okay.\nMohan Boddu: let those speak and see and let's capture other input here.\nMatt Heon: Miloslav. You need a meal.\nMohan Boddu: Emitter.\nMiloslav Trmac: the first question I think is, Can we keep up with Issues as they come if we can't. Then what we are doing. We Are not going to be in exactly the same conversations three months from now. And it's like Paul said, it's a matter of expectations if we can't handle the load, I think the report of these are to know, I don't know what that would look like. Maybe be close to issues and let only be us in, I don't know, but something needs to happen to stand the tide. If the incoming flow is manageable and we just have a backlog. I'm tempted to say that features are different from bugs and maybe shouldn't be closed, so aggressively. But ultimately a bankruptcy with all the issues is possible to me.\nMatt Heon: All right.\nMatt Heon: So it sounds like what we really want, is something akin to Bugzilla need info and then we'd auto close things that were Need info on reporter for say 90 days because ultimately, I think there's a Class A bug here where we have gets recorded and the Maintainer asks for more information and 90 days later, the information hasn't been provided. I'm fine with Auto closing that, I think that Paul is probably right that we don't want to auto close things that event ads any interaction at all for 90 days. But if it's 90 days of waiting on recorder, I would be fine with closing that I think the problem is that, I don't think it has the capability to do that sort of thing.\nMohan Boddu: Okay, I prefer that what you're saying, Matt and that's what I wanted to say. if we can do something like that, Bugzilla wise, And if you cannot do that, if there is no possibility of doing that in Github, the other option is Instead of auto closing them. we can write a bot, Or if you haven't heard anything From someone in the last 90 days. Ping them and ask them if it's still relevant or not. And maybe after 30 days or something like that, if they don't respond on the ticket, maybe close them. After that, initial thing.\nMatt Heon: If this is automatable, I am all in favor of it. I'm fearful if it's not Integrated with github and fully automated. It will be very difficult to manage.\nMohan Boddu: I think you can do this with Github actions. I'm not sure if there is a need info way of doing this, but at least the second one is to Google. as far as\nMatt Heon: If we could do a github action, that would apply a label. And then when there's a comment from the specific person who the label is for it, removes that label, that would be great. I think that would solve a lot of our problems.\nMatt Heon: I'll fly with that.\nPaul Holzinger: but, The stable board itself is a bit problematic because it hasn't the knowledge of which person is asking a question. So's just certainly there's action is also meaning nobody has looked at it, right, your comments but also Go into that and the sailboat. I think it's much more problematic, it's just fun here. So, There are issues for a year with all the comment that women captured by the stable. Don't ask me why I don't care. So it's not a reliable thing at all. So\n00:10:00\nMohan Boddu: I guess then we have to reframe the question maybe the board will ask there is no activity and ask whether the reporter still wants this bug or feature added. Then if that is reported response. Then. We don't close it. It doesn't matter who is responding at that point of time. The board doesn't know but at least it is a response on the ticket. It's just how we frame the question at that point of time.\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, I was just kind of thinking a little bit in the middle of Came back on it with some or they're not rather than using steel bought or some bot to auto close. The things that they sent a mail to maintainers or wherever and say This thing's old take a look at it and then have somebody actually physically review it before, closing it. I don't know if that'd be more palatable or not. Again, more overhead administration for a person.\nPaul Holzinger: So that's what we used to do, or what, then was pretty good at it. So, If the stable commented, he looked at it and usually closed out if it was what's open questions and stuff. But yeah, he is no longer on our team isn't that active anymore at least on the issue flight. So I think that's probably a large part or one of the reasons why the issue count goes up data part, it's just more issues than we got before.\nMatt Heon: Yeah. I would say that the fact that we're getting worse just indicative, we're use, which is good thing, but also a bad thing for us is maintainers\nMatt Heon: All right, so it sounds like we have a bunch of ideas, but most of these ideas are going to require scripting work. So this almost sounds like, you should put someone on it and see What is possible within the github actions API. Can we make close? This issues that are waiting for responders in the same way? Can we make something that identifies issues that are really old and if that no activity and pops us to, maybe it doesn't even send an email, maybe it just spits out a report and tells us. These are the issues that require attention oldest first and then we can go through five of those a week. It wouldn't solve things perfectly but it sounds cool.\nMatt Heon: Anyways, I think what I'm saying is, we probably should have time devoted for one person on the team to look at this at some point, the next couple weeks or a couple months. How does that sound? Okay.\nMatt Heon: I think that's a good action of Tom. I think we're going to move.\nAnders: So there was a user this weekend. I think that created a vagrant machine and then was connecting Portment to it and wondered why it was much more difficulty to do it. Using the portman kind compared to the doctor line. So it's something that we discussed whether we had Portman version 2 or something, but then we had Putman machine and Putman machine automatically sets up the stage connection. So then some of the problems were hidden in the connection and then other systems like here Lima or apartment desktop sets up SH tunnel for you. So the user only connects the unique socket and again the problem is not seen\n00:15:00\nAnders: but it was a reminder that we had some open issues from 2023 or even before that. And there is a lot of parameters that are mandatory in the SSH URL, that should not be. so,\nAnders: What I did was to just have some old code.\nAnders: So that you can read the Configuration also for the goal line, implementation of FSH which normally does not look at SSH, config I think that we have a half implemented native.\nAnders: Setting in Pod Man so that some commands will call out the Ssh binary. And some will use Golang. But the end result is that it doesn't work with the Config so what these systems like vague and Lima do is that they add ssh, config, which contains The username and the port number and the host name. And also the identity key. And then, you can access this alias. Instead of having to remember all these, it's especially annoying when you restart the VM and get the Newport airport, In Portland machine, there is functionality the update this connection automatically but it doesn't work for external systems. And I saw so that's what upcoming with some old apartment 4 codes. So that you can now\nAnders: Only do ssh to an alias and it Fill in your username. It will feel important, 22, That was fixed before and it will fill in the doctor. Sorry the podman socket path from the house by logging into the house and running port money. Info to see whether Unix rocket leaves on the remote side. So instead of remembering four different parameters, you only have to remember a short name which you keep in your SSH configure. I think I posted the number in the document here.\nAnders: Yes, Yeah, this is by the way, only if you don't provide this information, if you're the username,\u2026\nMatt Heon: Question are Liam and\u2026\nAnders: it's blank or the path is blank. If you have everything provided in the URL,\u2026\nMatt Heon: the others editing the actual dot. Config file on the user's SSH,\u2026\nAnders: then there's no code.\nMatt Heon: builders there are way that they're making a separate file. That has the identity.\nAnders: It is a separate file. So the user will have to either simulink this into the directory or cut it into the config file. If they wanted a part of it, Normally use the minus capital F even to use this specific as this age config but this is not covered by this. Code or anything. So the user is supposed to add the SSH,\u2026\nMatt Heon: Okay.\nAnders: config snippet for that host name into the normal parts either by SIM linking or\u2026\nMatt Heon: That's a lot less concerning than the actual sh. That makes me a little easier.\nAnders: by cutting\nMatt Heon: so, Would your ex sorry. Go ahead.\nAnders: Yeah, so it only costs that it only parses those four parameters. Hostname Port and Identity Key. So anything else would need to be supported by containers common and normal, native ssh fork. So if you have anything else, like you keep Alive and Max socket or what have you on your stage connection proxy, Young was also discussed, all of that is handled by the binary through containers, common because you have SSH mode, it's called if you want to use a go implementation or the Ssh. Exec.\nAnders: So you would need to use that external sh. For those open,\u2026\nMatt Heon: I'm trying to. Does anyone on the call?\nAnders: SSH features that are not included in the Golang implementation of SSH.\n00:20:00\nMatt Heon: Remember why we ended up using the Golang Ssh, Brent isn't here, and Ashley also list here and they would be the two. I would ask mostly\nAnders: I,\nPaul Holzinger: Yeah, so I think the native mode is probably just buggy in a sense that it doesn't work, really because it was implemented by Charlie. But then I think Charlie left before it was probably finished because I looked at the code, there are no tests so I wouldn't if they are not just,\u2026\nAnders: I,\nPaul Holzinger: I would not expect it to work in general that From working at this project.\nAnders: I think it's used by some commands but not by others, so for instance, Portman Fcp probably works fine, but podman run do not so it's\nPaul Holzinger: Yeah, So SAP has extra code bodman machine.\nAnders: Yeah.\nPaul Holzinger: SSH, also calls directly the binary all the time. so yeah,\u2026\nAnders: Yeah.\nPaul Holzinger: it's a bit of a mess and I think the native mode can probably easily be Fixed if somebody is interested in spending the time on that. but yeah, the Golden one, as you mentioned Figuring out the defaults is probably also just an edwin not having to provide the voice of the path and use other and so on.\nAnders: And there was a nice goal library, for parsing, the SSH, config files, all of that was already taken care of, which made the implementation much easier.\nJhon Honce: I don't think we knew that existed or it didn't exist when we wrote the initial Library implementation because that was one of the things we looked for and couldn't find And We just didn't take it on.\nAnders: I think the use of SSH config files is somewhat new. Because when we did this in 2020 or 2022, everyone was passing around URLs or other than using config files. But now in 2024,\u2026\nJhon Honce: The.\nAnders: it seems like it's a h, config file. So getting more common, for instance, Lima is moving to use them and deprecating that show SSH commander, as it was called, vagrant is deprecated in itself to not being open source anymore. So, Who cares, right?\nAnders: And yeah, but anyway, those four parameters seems to be working fine and I have some code that I tested on Ford of Nine of Odd, But I think it could be based without any major issues, that it hasn't been that many changes to the bindings.\nMatt Heon: I wouldn't mind to change like that honestly, more concerning to me is that we should get our internals in order and switch to one, SSH implementation or not have to, but switching over to just use SSA Fix, makes sense to me, especially considering what we've done with system. Connections moving out of containers comp into a separate file.\nAnders: .\nMatt Heon: There's precedent for them, not to be in the same place already.\nAnders: Yeah, unfortunately it's not just too implementations because you have your back clients, you have your JavaScript clients like Podman Desktop. So yeah, you have a lot of implementations of the circuit connection code. So, one thing that can be improved on the podman desktop site of things is to move the current temporary socket hacks from the podman Extension Department, In that way, it will also work with Doctor and Other extensions and so on. But it's quite new in the 112. So it's the going through some early phases at the moment. One issue we had with Lima was that it was hard to tell a local socket from a remote socket.\n00:25:00\nAnders: Log into the host or remote in some data center somewhere, that could be an Information for the use. But if we are just funneling Unix sockets and it's hard to tell from the Local thing. If it's a tunnel ssh or\u2026\nPaul Holzinger: I mean, we don't care on the Portman ends so that's\u2026\nAnders: if it's actually a remote associate.\nPaul Holzinger: what the client who has. Yeah. Yeah.\nAnders: It's a,\u2026\nAnders: it's quadman desktop that cares.\nPaul Holzinger: Right. Right.\nPaul Holzinger: Magic the client wants that,\u2026\nAnders: It wants to show different icons for different things.\nPaul Holzinger: but yeah.\nAnders: I think it will just be a Boolean on the connection connection is the class. That's wraps the circuit connection. So then each extension case, the fill this Boolean in our however it wants I think the current implementation is string starts with SSH colon or something like that. It's not so once But that's why it failed with the current limit sockets and that's why I looked at if we could feed the ssh connection from the limit as it config into Portman and then I really rediscovered. All these old issues with Adding the SSH.\nAnders: And also it's a bit messy to have to know the remote user ID of the VM or the cluster VM that you're using. Maybe you do know your current user, or you can use the environment variable for the runtime directory. But if it's remote VM, they have to get the remote user ID. so in that sense it's nicer if it figures it out, and I think that it does this today, if you do connection App, But it doesn't do it if you just provide. host or\u2026\nMatt Heon: Yeah, that sounds accurate.\nAnders: environment, variable URL or something.\nMatt Heon: Those were always meant to be power user features and I don't think we build any assistance into them.\nJhon Honce: But the connection ad did. So Anders is right there connection ad goes through, that was supposed to be the helper and go through a lot to try to figure out stuff.\nAnders: Yeah.\nAnders: Yeah, and that means that the original was never fixed because \u2026\nJhon Honce: And\u2026\nAnders: as long as you're using connection,\u2026\nJhon Honce: yes, the command line options,\u2026\nAnders: you don't see the problem.\nJhon Honce: if you went, that route were whatever you gave it. It slammed in and tried to make it work.\nAnders: Yeah, I mean it would log in with user,\u2026\nJhon Honce: Yes, Ugly things.\nAnders: empty string and stuff like that and It totally It also has some really interesting error code if you pause in an invalid UNIX socket, like empty string for the unique circuit. Because it will succeed to connect to the external site, so you don't get the nice. Post not found message or whatever, you did with a missing alias, but you will still get a weird error for not being able to connect to the circuit. Because it thinks it's talking to HTTP Server.\nAnders: And then it gets very surprised when it does not respond and it tries to check the URL and URL is fine but the path is all one piece out. Yeah it doesn't help the original problem you get whether and we had a errors From the backend.\nAnders: Yeah, ssh3. That connect failed. That's nice.\nAnders: But that's too old bugs getting a PR or maybe two PRS, maybe one.\nMatt Heon: I don't think I can promise it'll be worked on but I will definitely get a car together on our end to work on unifying our SSH implementations because having two just bothers me support perspective.\nAnders: Yeah.\nAnders: But it's sort of nice to have a built-in and golang fallback if open ssh becomes unavailable for some reason be it licensing or weird operating system or\u2026\n00:30:00\nJhon Honce: Yeah, I think.\nAnders: whatever but yeah. Weeks.\nJhon Honce: We can talk about that Matt, but I think you're stuck with two.\nMatt Heon: That is tragic. If true but your door familiar with me.\nAnders: And if you count put them on desktop you are probably going to be stuck with three. Unless, whatever you are, suggesting has a typescript implementation.\nJhon Honce: Yeah, no. And then, with podman pie. Now we have four\nAnders: But I do have some good news. And that is that windows now, support UNIX circuits, that's at least one less configuration. I guess that's only the recent windows.\nJhon Honce: that's nice.\nAnders: If you want to support older windows. You still have two. You have name pipes and unique circuits on Windows. Yeah, probably just makes it worse.\nPaul Holzinger: yeah, we can switch to that in 20 years once the clients They got that one out.\nAnders: Yeah.\nAnders: Yeah, exactly.\nAnders: I didn't have anything further, Tom.\nTom Sweeney: Anders are starting to catch up with the notes there for a moment. Think I've caught up any other questions, comments, any further ideas that we need to explore on this matter, others?\nMatt Heon: no, I think the capture what these to\nTom Sweeney: Okay, great with that. That's all we had for topics today. Are there any topics from the folks here that wanted to be Any questions or comments? In general.\nTom Sweeney: You thinking not real football, reminder, for Our next community meeting is on October 1st, don't pay attention to the agenda. That's on a Tuesday. Even number months, starting now community, meetings, odd number months, or cabal meetings. And so given that, our next cabal meeting will be on November 5th at 11:00 a.m. again and both meetings actually be at 11am, although we will have a time switch just before the November one.\nTom Sweeney: That I will see any further one last call for topics or questions.\nTom Sweeney: Going once I think I will stop the recording.\nTom Sweeney: And thank everybody for coming today.\nMeeting ended after 00:32:56 \ud83d\udc4b\nThis editable transcript was computer generated and might contain errors.

We are at the Podman Community Cabal meeting.\n\nTom Sweeney: as of now. Happy to take some more if folks want to. And the first one up we will be talking about improving the ease of contribution from Matten. And then Ray Roy Golan who I'm not sure is Feast here added a wallet management topic which I don't know a whole lot about. I just discovered a little while ago. So I'll see if Roy comes in or\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: \n\nTom Sweeney: So Matt you do discuss it anyway.\n\nBrent Baude: I do.\n\nBrent Baude: I know enough to hopefully they're here.\n\nTom Sweeney: Okay, great.\n\nMatt Heon: \n\nMatt Heon: I think he might be coming to the other cabal the win next week. okay sure.\n\nTom Sweeney: All maybe we can talk about it a little bit and move on and see where it goes. So, Matt, I will hand it to you.\n\nMatt Heon: So as some people may have noticed we have been doing a big cleanup to a lot of our userfacing documentation around contributing to the project especially podband but really all containers repos and this is just us noticing that some of these had docs hadn't been changed in seven years really and it's probably a good idea to get things up to date and make it an inviting environment for new people to contribute to the project because I know in the past it has been difficult to get PRs into Podman and we'd really like to change that.\n\nMatt Heon: So this is basically an open discussion of how do we make it more inviting for people to contribute especially to Potman but also to our other repos. And I think that what right now we're focusing on making the documentation easier for people to first timers can get PRs in easier. But a lot of the people working on this have been Podman maintainers for a very long time. So our visibility into what the New Year user experience is isn't exactly the\n\nPaul Holzinger: \n\nPaul Holzinger: I think one thing that is missing in portman is sort of a architecture overview end code structure if you look at the repo where do you start looking if you have a bug right so it's just some basic docs we have cmdotman is the CLI infrastructure and then you flip out with the integrated parts of running the containers and\u2026\n\nNeil Smith: \n\nPaul Holzinger: and so I think that this is probably pretty difficult to figure out as a beginner.\n\nNeil Smith: What do you want to do with this information,\u2026\n\nNeil Smith: Matt? Do you want to put it in? Okay.\n\nMatt Heon: Tom I believe is taking notes. So we will have a record at the end of anything that we've decided on. I think we have an architecture diagram for all our projects identified as a priority like but that's not exactly what Paul's saying.\n\nBrent Baude: Perfect. I would agree.\n\nMatt Heon: Paul wants some internal code documentation. we can say this is where the podman core container management lives and this is where the API lives. I think that's different and I don't think that is something I would really like to do. I don't think it would take particularly long just to do this is the introduction to the podman repo. important stuff lives. This is where the tests live. This is how you should add a new feature if you want to. I think that's a very reasonable thing.\n\nMatt Heon: My question would be\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: I'd be happy to take a card on that as long as it doesn't need to be done in the next two weeks. Yeah.\n\nMatt Heon: where Okay, that could be arranged. I wonder\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: \n\nMatt Heon: where this should live. I mean, it could be a MD, but this could just as easily be a blog we put out that's like this is the intro to how to contribute to Podman. This is the things you should do. This is where all the code lives. So, I feel like a blog would be useful here, although we could link it from other\n\nBrent Baude: My personal feeling would be some form of a extension of the contributing dock that's already in the repo.\n\nBrent Baude: That's the permanent home. But I also think a blog that kind of summarizes that content would be something that we could get out there and wouldn't have to be all the nitty-gritty detail. Absolutely. Unbolt.\n00:05:00\n\nPaul Holzinger: Yeah, I think it needs to live in the repo because you need to update it with the ethical code changes. A block might be nice advertising, but we have a lot of old blocks out there which people site to and we say, that's just no longer how you do it.\n\nMohan Boddu: Just want to say something. not to put you a friend of the line as you recently started contributing maybe you have some ideas of where we are missing some things and things like that. So if you would like to share that that would be useful as well.\n\nJan Rodak: The architecture overview I agree with that and also that missing documentation is started creating. So, I think it's on the good way. And right now, I haven't got anything else.\n\nBrent Baude: \n\nBrent Baude: I have an old acorn I can bring up which I still think that for a contributor who even does just a dock chain validating or getting a sense that your PR might actually pass all our hoops locally before you push it is still a big hurdle that's been kind of a since we got CI that was more difficult than make validate or something, and we get contributors that are on Windows and\u2026\n\nTom Sweeney: No.\n\nBrent Baude: Mac. I think to me that's still an issue.\n\nPaul Holzinger: I would question if they care though, if they would actually spend the time running this that sometimes I have the feeling that most contributors are not really\n\nNeil Smith: Yeah, especially for little things, right?\n\nBrent Baude: I think on the limping and some of the DCO checks and things like that, that to me is 3/4 of what we end up having to go back to people on. So, if a contributing doc said, \"If you want to contribute, here's the process.\" And by the way before you push it run a make validate because it checks for the ticky marks you need. it is bothersome to me that we can't always run our integration suite locally it has to be run in a very specific environment for it to pass. That's bothersome to me.\n\nBrent Baude: \n\nBrent Baude: But I think the bigger part is\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: if we can wipe out I'll say the paperwork portion of a submission that I agree probably doesn't make a difference in the long run.\n\nPaul Holzinger: Yeah, but I mean I agree with the DCO thing,\u2026\n\nPaul Holzinger: but that's in the doc. So everybody that hasn't edited hasn't read the doc, So that's what I'm trying to get at. I agree as simple make validate. I'm not sure what the problem with the current Mac validator is. I guess you mentioned Mac and Windows. I guess that's fair. yeah, I don't know how to solve that really. It's\n\nBrent Baude: \n\nBrent Baude: We're still going to have that, but it's a lot easier to go see the contributing doc than to walk them through all the things that they need to do if we actually have a command that works just even go in there and say run make validate. building on top of that is the second one.\n\nTom Sweeney: Okay.\n\nBrent Baude: I think it's half contributors, particularly new ones we're seeing now is we're getting drive by PRs, which is good. But what we're not getting is those merged and there is more delay in reviewing than I think we would be happy with these days.\n\nBrent Baude: \n\nBrent Baude: But I think the other piece is're not getting the reason I use driveby is because we're not getting a second return after they submit and we review. They're not going and\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: doing it. we may need to nudge them a fair amount. I don't know if there's something we can do there, but I would say that that is a problem worth looking at.\n00:10:00\n\nTom Sweeney: And that's often time issues that they've run into and\u2026\n\nTom Sweeney: they never come back to tweak it's a simple thing. You guys take care of it. Bye. See you.\n\nPaul Holzinger: I mean I think you can categorize a contributor in two parts. somebody who identified a problem and decided to here's a fix but I don't actually have the motivation to become a contributor to the project permanent or whatever and somebody who would like to contribute more often or understand the whole flow and so on it we don't know what the person wants right if they sort of give you this one fix you take it and I would be happy to just finish it but I don't know what the motivation of the contributor was so\n\nBrent Baude: \n\nBrent Baude: And then I guess one thing that I've been questioning about with the new PRs coming in from the review side, which maybe suggests we have a problem, is I don't typically review stuff that doesn't pass tests or\u2026\n\nTom Sweeney: Oops.\n\nBrent Baude: isn't very close to passing tests. If I see a DCO or something like that, I just stop. Is what's the rest of the team doing? because that might be handy to mention in the contributing like we don't really go and review stuff till it's\n\nMatt Heon: \n\nMatt Heon: That's especially problematic Greg because some of these are waiting on a reviewer to look at it and add the bloat approved label or add what do you call it one of our other no test needed labels. So CI being read is not a guarantee that it's not good for review.\n\nBrent Baude: \n\nMatt Heon: I do go in and I try and look at all PRs to the extent that I can understand at least why CI is failing.\n\nBrent Baude: I do too.\n\nBrent Baude: I'm not saying that I don't see the little green dot and move on. I'm saying I don't review if I'm actually the one that's been putting a lot of the no new tests on their approval. So, I do look at those, but if it's actually failing tests, then I don't typically go much further\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: because I don't know if it's valuable. I would lean towards whatever the team thinks we should be doing as long as the team's consistent.\n\nMiloslav Trmac: It's a hard tradeoff.\n\nMiloslav Trmac: Sometimes you want to look at it and say, \" this approach is completely wrong. Rewrite it before starting to fix tests.\" And sometimes just the tests are enough to show that there is more work to be done.\n\nPaul Holzinger: \n\nPaul Holzinger: I think the difficult problem for contributors is figuring out how to navigate the test lock how to even figure out that they have a failure that is waiting on them right because if you check marks will be read for flakes right and if the contributor is looking into a flake what did I broke and start debugging things that's totally wasteful of time when I go there and yeah that's this flake I restarted So, I try to look at all the PRs regardless\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: \n\nPaul Holzinger: if they pass tests or not and then usually I just copy and paste the failure into PR comment for them so they see what's going on and see how they respond.\n\nBrent Baude: I mean,\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: I think it's a good template if we all do it. I will always look at why it failed as well. If it's a flake,\u2026\n\nTom Sweeney: Come on. Yeah.\n\nBrent Baude: I'll rerun it. And I think we need more maintainers going through that pipeline throughout the day. because as you well know that flakes can occur at any given time whatever.\n\nBrent Baude: So, if, Paul and I are the only ones pushing buttons, let's just say, it's going to be largely done in the US morning and then not get attention thereafter cuz that's usually when I go through PRs. Paul, I like the idea of pasting the failure if we're doing a review to help out or explicitly saying this is not a flake. You have a test failure. If that's something we can put in practice, I think that immediately helps contributors.\n00:15:00\n\nMario Loriedo: maybe what we can do is that we can responsilize so making the contributor more responsible and saying having an default messages that say we're not going to look at your PR until the tests are green if you think that there is a flag because flag can happen just and we can provide the command that will kind\n\nTom Sweeney: Perfect.\n\nMario Loriedo: of being because the contributor may think that there is a flake and he cannot do anything and today I think a contributor is expecting us to look for flakes but if we tell him hey we may not have the time to look at all the flakes so if you think it's a flake please tell us so that we are aware about it and we are going to look at it but usually we look at PRs if All the tests are passing.\n\nPaul Holzinger: Yeah, but even that is difficult in a sense how would they know if it's a flag or not then for me it takes me 5 seconds to decide if a test is a flag or not at most if I on the GitHub message I see the test name I thought before that it was a flag I press rerun right but expecting that from somebody else is that doesn't\n\nPaul Holzinger: \n\nPaul Holzinger: And generally for integration at system test, it's pretty easy to say if it's only one that's red, it's probably a flake. And if you have a bunch of threats, that's not a flake. But even that doesn't need to be true. And it's not true for I don't know machine tests where we only have one in hyper rerun, Either you have a real hyperb failure or you have a flag in hyper. So you kind of generalize these kinds of scenarios. I don't know.\n\nMario Loriedo: \n\nMario Loriedo: Yeah, the thing is that\u2026\n\nPaul Holzinger: And I don't\n\nMario Loriedo: if we are the only one looking so I if the contributor feels like you should not look at the test because anyway we are the one looking at the test logs so we'll need to work to look at all the results of the test. I think that we should tell them hey please go ahead and look yourself you may not understand everything so there are a lot of things that are understandable especially there is a linting problem and it's helpful that the contributor start looking and learning how to look at the logs of the CI test the\n\nMario Loriedo: test because that's the path to becoming a contributor anyway. He needs to understand how the CI works. But I think that today we do not guide him at all. We do not say hey for example something that I figure out after a few weeks and I didn't know the HTML file that helped you a lot figuring out so what's going on in the test. So this is something that is completely hidden. we do not disclose that in our documentation or contributing guides.\n\nBrent Baude: \n\nTom Sweeney: Oops. Right.\n\nBrent Baude: One other thing that's been weighing my mind and\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: I'll just ask the whole group. has anyone work we have this changes requested thing in GitHub as well. Has anyone worked with a repository or project where if a maintainer puts a label or a label exists on a PR that users remove labels or is that project project by project?\n\nMario Loriedo: No, they cannot. They\n\nBrent Baude: \n\nPaul Holzinger: You need to give them permissions to triage.\n\nPaul Holzinger: Permissions are needed, I believe, or maybe more.\n\nBrent Baude: \u2026\n\nBrent Baude: So, what I'm getting at is I think for me when I look at we have a lot of PRs now and if it were to pick up this would be even worse. But, I keep going back to the same PR and it hasn't moved. So, it would be nice to know when it has moved as a maintainer on the maintainer side, but I'm guessing that the contributors have very little opportunity to, like I said, remove a label or do something that would bump\n00:20:00\n\nBrent Baude: \n\nBrent Baude: Yes. Yeah.\n\nPaul Holzinger: So they can request a video from a user. I believe that possible. but then they would know what to request from. Technically the open shift bot is randomly listing one of the owners right when they say hey assign that person. I don't think anybody pays attention to that.\n\nBrent Baude: Because I mean there is a lot of time loss in going through the same set of PRs that you've been going through hoping or waiting for that to do something.\n\nPaul Holzinger: \n\nPaul Holzinger: So generally if I added a comment or then I get the notifications, So I generally don't check again or you don't even have to add a comment. You could sub subscribe\u2026\n\nTom Sweeney: Any other thoughts or\u2026\n\nPaul Holzinger: but if you subscribe you get all the force push comments while they fix stuff. So that's not really what you're looking for either, While they still iterating on their\n\nBrent Baude: \n\nBrent Baude: Yeah, I'm trying to help the user by having less noise on us. I think you did it.\n\nTom Sweeney: comments on this topic before we move on? Just checking here to see if Roy has come aboard. I do not see Roy. I thought I saw him ping through, but I'm not seeing him.\n\nBrent Baude: Yeah. It might be worth time seeing\u2026\n\nTom Sweeney: No. You said he's a Red Hat person,\u2026\n\nMatt Heon: It looks like it dropped.\n\nBrent Baude: if you can ping them and we could just wait a minute.\n\nTom Sweeney: Okay.\n\nPaul Holzinger: Yeah, I mean fundamentally to me the problem with reviewing is this what I mentioned that there are the two types of persons.\n\nBrent Baude: \n\nPaul Holzinger: I don't know if it's worth spending a bunch of time explaining, how to do that stuff and then they never come back because they don't have to. It's It's totally fine. But, Yeah.\n\nBrent Baude: Yeah. I think you have to take away the I didn't know\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: what to do portion though when you run a big project and you're going to have drivebys.\n\nBrent Baude: All Tom, while you're doing that, I can maybe talk about what the other topic was because I did come to me first. Okay.\n\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, I did ping him,\u2026\n\nTom Sweeney: but he's turned his notifications off. I don't know where he lives.\n\nBrent Baude: So we won't get terribly far, but I'll float the generalized idea of this was that he had essentially a CLI for maintaining quadlets. this really sort of simplifying some of the what do you have, how etc. So I guess it kind of equates to a lot of the podman commands that we have where we have an image store and we like to be able to list them and do all the v inspection and all the other kinds of things and he's got it in a separate repo and he asked me whether I thought this kind of function would be attractive to either podman or to some sort of quadlet itself but\n\nBrent Baude: essentially. Is that him? No. he was basically asking whether or not this topic or this kind of thing would be appropriate for Podman or Quadlet itself. And then my response was I think it's a great cabal topic. so that's how we kind of got here. So we can generally debate, although I would feel more comfortable if there were more Quadlet folks.\n\nDaniel Walsh: \n\nBrent Baude: We can generally debate whether this would be something useful or not. And I can meanwhile try to go find the repository while you guys It looks like Dan's going to talk. So I'll go look for it.\n\nDaniel Walsh: This different.\n\nDaniel Walsh: This is different than podlet or\n\nBrent Baude: Paul's got it here. Let me just look to see if That's it, pal. Thank you. So, if you go look there, you get kind of an idea. And again, I was not respon anything. I thought about it was not a response of that exact thing is a great idea. I was sort of trying to bubble it up to do we think this is appropriate for what we know about Quadlet and what we offer to folks and would it be a good thing?\n00:25:00\n\nMatt Heon: \n\nBrent Baude: So it's not exactly is that what we want. is this topic something valuable and should we talk about it?\n\nMatt Heon: I think the user experience here is an unambiguous win over Quadlets right now.\n\nPaul Holzinger: So yeah,\u2026\n\nMatt Heon: So honestly my position is why aren't we doing this\n\nPaul Holzinger: I'm trying to make sense of what exactly it's doing. But yeah, I mean listing your files or adding a new file and is sort of just batching a bunch of commands, right? Move the file in this directory, reload system CDL and start it and stuff like that. certainly useful for users, I guess. I don't know what else it's doing. Yeah. Or what\n\nBrent Baude: \n\nDaniel Walsh: \n\nBrent Baude: Dan, you're a big Quadlet supporter.\n\nBrent Baude: On that early\n\nDaniel Walsh: Yes, I think it's an interesting idea.\n\nDaniel Walsh: People hear the word quadlet and it's difficult to find the word quadlet inside of podman. so this would bring it more to the forefront. there is a tool called podlet which also does something similar in that it generates a quadlet from a container. so having a podman quadlet list and looking at the quadlets that are installed on the system u and\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: it opens up more long-term like you said to you could clearly see podman quadlet generate from a running container as an example.\n\nDaniel Walsh: making it easier for users to install them and manage them. if we want to make it more of a first class citizen I think you'd be useful.\n\nBrent Baude: There are a couple other people, obviously the Quadlet folks, but there are a couple other people I'd actually like to bounce this off. Ben Briard is a huge Quadlet fan.\n\nDaniel Walsh: All right.\n\nBrent Baude: And a container guy, so I think it would be good to bounce off him. I'll take that one.\n\nPaul Holzinger: So one thing I would don't know I wouldn't like this as part of a portman command\u2026\n\nPaul Holzinger: because quadlet itself is sort of systemd Linux only right and then if everything you add to portman pretty much nowadays is remote client or should work via remote client rather right So even if you say it's only working local, some document out there says Potman something and somebody's going to type it on Windows, Mac OS, whatever, right? so I think having these things separate to I think it's a very bad thing that people don't understand that there is Potman remote and\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: \n\nBrent Baude: Is that a bad thing? Is it No,\u2026\n\nPaul Holzinger: Potman local. I think.\n\nBrent Baude: I get that. But, is it a bad thing? I mean, I would think Mac users would want to be able to run a Quadlet.\n\nDaniel Walsh: \n\nPaul Holzinger: It's system D.\n\nBrent Baude: I know,\u2026\n\nMatt Heon: Run it out the VM.\n\nBrent Baude: but run on the VM or whatever the remote connection is.\n\nPaul Holzinger: Yeah. I don't know.\n\nBrent Baude: And we could also make it only on Linux.\n\nDaniel Walsh: You're going to have an issue.\n\nDaniel Walsh: There are going to be issues with that. If you want to allow pod man quadlet install now all sudden we can do it. It's all can be done. one. Yeah,\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: We could go out the door that way and just see whether it takes off or not. Okay,\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh: it might be helpful to have an error message when someone types Pman Quadlet on a Mac to say this is a Linux only feature.\n\nMatt Heon: \n\nBrent Baude: Or we could also do\u2026\n\nMatt Heon: Yeah, we can definitely provide that.\n\nDaniel Walsh: \n\nMatt Heon: I would love to do a trial implementation in Podman local and then if we get success with that we can easily spin it or do extra work to get it\n00:30:00\n\nDaniel Walsh: What's that?\n\nBrent Baude: what we did with compose which is if a pintary is there then we honor it and if not we don't. Lots of ways around that. again I think we focus on whether we think this is a solid idea. It sounds like we wouldn't have to do all the lifting here.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Just think about ourselves right now. Do you know if you have Quadlets installed in your machine?\n\nBrent Baude: Do I?\n\nDaniel Walsh: If you played with Quadlets in the past, you have to go look at a weird directory to figure out if they're installed. Yeah.\n\nBrent Baude: That's what I mean. but also on the flip side, the fact that it is somewhat standardized to the weird directory allows us to write wrappers to it.\n\nDaniel Walsh: \n\nDaniel Walsh: I'm just saying it'd be nice to be able to get that information through this command.\n\nBrent Baude: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Show me what I have installed. Yeah.\n\nBrent Baude: I could also theoretically see stock piece, sort of a quadlet over a URL. So, someone could have it sitting in a GitHub repository and snort it right in.\n\nDaniel Walsh: \n\nPaul Holzinger: Yeah, I personally don't like to absorb everything into main portman and\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh: There are other comm I look at\u2026\n\nPaul Holzinger: stuff like that because I mean functionality wise I have no objections or that something like that is useful but every line that is added to Portman puts burden onto us and I don't know it's I think bug reports for things nobody pay attention to and\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh: but I look at Yeah.\n\nPaul Holzinger: and I don't want even more things. Nobody has one person.\n\nDaniel Walsh: I just think Quadlet's kind of a special case. I was just in a discussion on Finch as a competitor to,\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: \n\nDaniel Walsh: I think Brent was involved in a little bit. And Quadlet is a feature of Podman that is pretty popular and very different than everybody else in the market right now.\n\nBrent Baude: unique. Yeah.\n\nDaniel Walsh: And so you ra ra ra rather than hiding that we should probably embrace it as opposed to you all the rest of the time we're playing catchup. we got to compose support\n\nBrent Baude: So Tom, if I was to summarize, I'd say we like the idea. We don't know anything about the implementation and design dock required. Does anyone want to disagree with we don't like the idea? We like the idea rather.\n\nDaniel Walsh: \n\nBrent Baude: If that gentleman comes to the other cabal or whatever, I told him he could come to a team meeting too. It doesn't matter.\n\nDaniel Walsh: Yeah. there's another one dry run\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh: which is built into quad lit which sort of proofreads a quadlet which we don't have now. That'd be kind of nice to be able to debug your quad lit before you push it into production. What kind of service is this quad going to generate? I've even been help testing\n\nDaniel Walsh: He's in Israel.\n\nTom Sweeney: Testing, muting. I think we're at the end of the discussion. Does anybody have anything further to say or add to it?\n\nMatt Heon: I like the idea. I'm forgetting the name of the guy who created this tool, but I would really like to talk to him and if we can get him in another coal, that would be great.\n\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, Roy Goolan. He's apparently in Europe somewhere.\n\nBrent Baude: \n\nTom Sweeney: Not sure exactly.\n\nBrent Baude: Yeah, I was hesitant to say Roy\u2026\n\nBrent Baude: because it could be Wah, but yeah, likewise.\n\nTom Sweeney: Yep. My apologies\u2026\n\nTom Sweeney: if I've misspoken, So, all that good talk on that. So, let's see if there are any open discussions. Anybody has any topics they'd like to add before we head out. Okay, while we're still thinking about that,\u2026\n\nDaniel Walsh: \n\nBrent Baude: We got our monthly Dan. Good to see you.\n\nDaniel Walsh: I'm actually actually working on a pull request for Podman right now.\n\nDaniel Walsh: So, I'm trying to figure out why my coupl is not working. Anyways,\n00:35:00\n\nTom Sweeney: I will point out that our next meeting for the call is on January 7th, 2025. All right, year's coming to a close and our next community meeting is on December 3rd, 2024. Same time, 11 o'clock both times and on Tuesdays. So, one last call for any other topics. Otherwise, I will close this one out. All right, folks. Thanks for coming today and we'll shut down the recording.\nMeeting ended after 00:35:37 \ud83d\udc4b\n\nThis editable transcript was computer generated and might contain errors.

Today is Tuesday February 4th 2025 report. as a reminder what this meetings is all about. We meet on the first Tuesday of even a number of months such as February, April so forth and we may move the timing from time to time to make it friendlier for India to China and Australia although we haven't done that for a while. We probably ought to.  topics are driven from prior meetings or requests to me at tweeny redhot.com or you can add them to the agenda as Castello did which is great love that we accept any discussions that are related to podman buildilda scopio or any related container projects here we also have a kind of a cousin meeting a podman cabal meeting which happens on the odd number of months on Tuesdays first one of the month and that's more of a design and ideas for changes for podman kind of a meeting I'll be taking the meeting notes inside the hack committee\nTom Sweeney: noted here. If you see that I've messed anything up or you want to add to it, especially if you have any URLs that you want to include, please let me know. And presenters, if you could send me any of your slides after the meeting, I would appreciate it and I will include those. So, today we are going to start off with a Podman v 5.4 update which is coming up in the next couple weeks here. And then Matt will also go and talk about the firewall D and Podman update. Neil's going to give us an update on where we stand in our move to CNCF for Podman buildcopying and others.  Brent's going to be giving us a demo for artifacts which is a new feature that's coming in with pod 5.4. Paul will be talking about netark's new features that are coming up shortly. That tool will be involved with 54.4 release although net itself but kind of tagged together. And then Gustto will be talking about personal multi session containers and cest. And with that I will hand it off to Matt to start us up.\nMatt Heon: All right, we have a packed schedule. So, I will try and keep things brief. let me go ahead and share the release notes and just Okay, so as people may be tracking, we are in the release candidate phase for Podman two weeks ago we did RC1. Last week we did RC2.  I am expecting RC3 today or maybe early tomorrow depending on how things go and final release should be next week assuming all goes just a brief overview of what to expect. Our starring feature is support for OCI artifacts. This is still very early. it's not fully feature complete and we reserve the right to change the user interface because obviously we're still figuring out what the best way of doing things is.\nMatt Heon: feedback very welcomed. But we've added a suite of commands under part man artifacts which are used for interacting with OCI artifacts, pushing them to registries, pulling them down and obviousations for this are going to be putting large files particularly AI models but basically anything inside of containers easily. we have a bunch of other updates.  We have some updates to podman update which allows you to make changes to health checks. We now have subpath support for volumes. We do have two breaking changes I would like to highlight. we don't usually do these outside of major releases, but we decided these were not sufficiently large to require a major release. number one, Podman on Mac and specifically Podman on Intel Macs.\nMatt Heon: We don't have sufficient hardware to adequately test this and at the moment we're basically moving it over to best effort support. We will still accept patches related to it. We are still going to be producing binaries and machine images so you can still use it. But our ability to fix bugs is limited by developer access to hardware. If anyone wants to step up and help us maintain this, we would welcome that. But for now, we are moving it down to best ever support only.  And second one, there is a minor change to how comments were handled in quadlets which involves an accident where instead of using semicolons for comments like system D does, we accidentally coded it up to use colons instead. we're fixing that so it uses semicolons. I doubt many people found this feature but if you did, you will have to change your quad files for podman 54. So that I believe is a good summary of what to expect.\nMatt Heon: We have a good bevy of bug fixes. We've got some minor API changes and I'm expecting some additional fixes to land shortly related to putting NVIDIA devices inside of containers, particularly using the remote API and Docker Compose. And yeah, that's about it for Podman 54 updates. next up was Podman Firewall D. I will also keep this one brief.  So Firewald D has added a new feature in Firewall D230 which isn't released yet. No, I'm wrong about that. It's released, but it's not in DRO yet. That's what I was trying to say. but it's called strict forward ports. Is not enabled by default, but if it is turned on, it basically prevents all port forwarding from happening with Podman containers.\n00:05:00\nMatt Heon: We have included a patch in the net version that will ship with podman 5.4 that will throw a helpful error if this happens. But basically TLDDR if you turn on strict forward ports and firewall D you cannot use podman run hyphen P you're going to have to manually forward the ports with the firewall D API. and the reason behind this I imagine is system administrators who don't want podman automatically forwarding ports through the firewall. So not enabled by default but if you do enable it things get very different. Okay. Tom, back to you.\nTom Sweeney: Okay, great, Matt. Thanks. Anybody have any questions on any of that?\nTom Sweeney: Righty, I'm just going to give it a quick beat between these since we do have a number of talks today. And with that, I will hand it over to Neil to start up our CNCF discussion.\nNeil Smith: Okay, I'm just sharing my screen with and\u2026\nNeil Smith: I'll give you the issue tone to put in the minutes. But we're very happy what they call the TOC has accepted our application to contribute podman and build and scopio and a few other things to CNCF and we're going through the onboarding process right now which may have some changes that will be impacting us in the future.\nNeil Smith: which is like we're going to set up a Slack channel in CNCF so we might have to think about how the messaging platforms we already use matrix and stuff like that and we'll probably have to think about our mailing lists and stuff like that as well but we'll be going through these tasks.  So basically some of these things are here where we have to figure out we have our podman io domains that we have to give change to CNCF ownership. We have to send them our artwork the seals etc. And some more website changes. we've done already the DCO.\nNeil Smith: we have to make sure our code of conduct is up to date and our list of maintainers is sent to them etc. So not big things but we'll be starting that and one of the big things was that we were supposed to move our GitHub to a standalone repository but we will be not doing that immediately because it has large impacts to our CI/CD and that's the update.  So, we're planning on they want us to try to get this all done within a month. So, we'll be working on that and then we'll move on to work on moving through sandbox into incubation. And I can put the link in chat. That's it. Any questions? Correct.\nTom Sweeney: Just a clarification, the GitHub move isn't planned within a month, Is all the documentation,\u2026\nNeil Smith: Yeah. Yes.\nTom Sweeney: procedural kind of stuff.\nNeil Smith: Mostly documentation procedural except for I think the messaging might be something that we move a bit quicker on or something like that. But we'll figure it out. We'll let everybody know and do it publicly. It's all in the CNCF world.\nTom Sweeney: So given that, thank you, And next up, Brent doing demos for the artifacts that we're just talking about a little while ago.\nNeil Smith: You're on mute, Brent. Yeah,\u2026\nBrent Baude: How are we looking? Is that legible?\nNeil Smith: good size. Yeah, good side.\nBrent Baude: All so as has been mentioned, one of the features going into 54 that we're excited about is revolves around OCI artifacts. And this is our initial implementation.  It's largely at this point around the ability to be able to manage these artifacts and they are managed much container images and so in the sense that they're managed on the local file system unlike manifests purely they're kind of managed they have I'll say a little bit of a state information you can see\n00:10:00\nBrent Baude: the typical verbs associated with most of our objects in that we have an add and an inspect and a list a push and remove. the upside here is because you're dealing with image registries pull and push are going to be largely the same as pushing with images including the various TLS certificate related options that come with that.  So, I thought I'd just walk through a typical workflow and show it off a little bit and then please, if there are questions, just do the hand raised thing and I'll pause and you can ask a question. All right. So, to look at what's in our current local store, you can use something like LS. here we've got a very similar look.\nBrent Baude: I currently don't have anything pulled. It should be very similar as images there. that's intentional to try to keep some comfortability between what folks already know and what we're displaying.  The ls command has is one of the ones that has a few different options. we can much like images there's a format, there's a no trunk which means you get the f full digest and then the no heading which just removes the header off of what's returned.\nBrent Baude: we can also do things like pull. I have a multifile artifact sitting on quay that I'll pull. and you can see there very quickly it's the same user experience you get with container images, which is intentional.  And if we take a look there, that's how that is displayed. if you have multiple files, the size is the summary of all of them or the accumulation of all of them.\nBrent Baude: Inspecting an artifact is very much the same as what you're used to seeing in the sense that it's the same format options, but the output is slightly different. And this is just a makeup of what an artifact more or less looks like with the exception of the name and in the digest.\nBrent Baude: here we have a single artifact image. It's can be reflected as a single layer in there. And the original title of the file was one two three. If we look at here now you see there are multiple layers.\nBrent Baude: Dan, I'll hit that at the end if that's cool. and you can see there they're just RD1 and RD2 and they see the size and bytes. also there I have a file called new artifact. It's just a gzipped data file if you will and you can add that to your store.\nBrent Baude: by doing something like I mean it doesn't even have to be that it can be fooar latest and you give it the name and then the path to it pod man artifact add  the fully qualified image reference. We will not do short names with artifacts. And then you can pass one or more files. So there's another one called homework. I can do two files and the digest comes back. It's worth looking at the add command.\n00:15:00\nBrent Baude: There's also now the ability to annotate the artifact files as well as set an artifact type which is the overall type for the  artifact ad will we have a teammate who is currently got a PR that's probably quite close it won't make 54 I don't believe but it allows you to go in and do something like let's say you wanted to do something like this and you already have that local we're going to\nBrent Baude: have an append flag here that would allow you to take an existing artifact and add a new file to it. which will y. It'll be a nice feature. All right. probably we already saw a push.  I'm not going to demo cuz it just will take up bandwidth. But a very very similar experience as before. And then if you want to remove it's quite simple here pod man artifact remove hit enter and you get the digest back just as an acknowledgement that it removed it.\nBrent Baude: So, where we're going, I talked about the append one. There's a soon to be introduced extract where you can take a artifact file out of the manage store and pipe it to somewhere on your file system.  And then the big clencher is and the whole reason we're doing this is we'll write a volume driver for artifacts such that you can mount an artifact right into the container as a volume. you can easily imagine that you're trying to run some AI workload and you want an ML that's distributed artifact inside your container.\nBrent Baude: that will become almost trivial to do. and that's really use case number one and goal number one for us. So you'll see development on that over the course of the next quarter. Questions before I talk about Dan's question with our volumes.\nGerry Seidman: I have a question regarding additional layer storage. this when I'm sure you're aware of the image volumes in the Kubernetes world but what you're talking about mapping a volume is analogous it will artifacts travel through the ALS path in order to take advantage of the advant of ALS or not with your volumes. Yeah.\nGerry Seidman: where you're going with mounting artifact volumes\u2026\nBrent Baude: No, it'll be largely a bind mount.\nGerry Seidman: if there\u2026\nGerry Seidman: but will it do a bind mount from will ALS also does a bind mount but are there without ALS it downloads the artifact and\u2026\nBrent Baude: Okay. \u2026\nBrent Baude: can you tell us?\nGerry Seidman: and expands it locally and with ALS doesn't have to do that. Additional air storage.\nBrent Baude: We're not actually touching the artifact. However, we're pulling it down and in the form that it was pushed will be the same form it ends up in the container. Yep.\nGerry Seidman: Understood. Okay. I'll have to see how you implement it because there are many advantages of additional layer storage for artifacts.  In fact, this came up in a meeting with a client with an end user yesterday.\nBrent Baude: Jerry, I'm happy to continue to have conversations with you on that. I am being asked.\nPaul Holzinger: I think the answer is our artifact store is completely separate from our existing image storage and\u2026\n00:20:00\nPaul Holzinger: and the additional storage that are attached to that. So the artifact location is separate and there's no sharing going on.\nGerry Seidman: \u2026\nGerry Seidman: since it goes through the storage libraries, if you have ALS enabled, it would automatically do that because the storage libraries don't care. Is that what you're saying, Paul? does not okay. All right. There would be advantages of it doing it though.\nDan Walsh: I think Jerry why don't you take a look at what's been implemented and if you have ideas we consider obviously pulling these things locally is I mean when you're talking about AI images or\u2026\nGerry Seidman: right.\nDan Walsh: if you're talking about things like cucos and things like that they are huge. So if there was advantages that we could allow customers to take advantage of them to needed to pull\u2026\nDan Walsh: then that would be helpful.\nBrent Baude: Yeah, what we're trying really Jerry that the technology behind it's not been much of a challenge.\nBrent Baude: The challenge is determining how people are going to actually use these and not some weird edge use case that we better, our interface on.\nBrent Baude: So the hardest part has been really kind of narrowing down how do we get the most use out of managing artifacts for folks and getting them in the K container because the reality is for advanced function we have manifests we have a manifest command with all its verbs and it's quite flexible here we're just trying to do simplification of how to deal with manifests and how  going to deal with artifacts.\nGerry Seidman: Okay. Again,\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Yeah. Thank you.\nGerry Seidman: I haven't looked at the implementation. I'll have to look at it.\nDan Walsh: there is the drivers for this right now are mainly AI and getting something into Kubernetes so you can imagine if you had right now in Kubernetes when people are running AI models they're just using S3 content so Kubernetes really doesn't know about what's going on but as an OCI content then Kubernetes could manage it so it would know when to pull it,\u2026\nDan Walsh: which containers are using things like that. So that's the number one goal for and similarly for colets and things like that. Image artifacts versus images. Yeah, it does.\nGerry Seidman: Yeah, I was under the impression that image volumes were going through the same storage.\nGerry Seidman: No, no, the Kubernetes 131 new volume type called an image volume.\nDan Walsh: So that's in there,\u2026\nGerry Seidman: Yeah. right? Yeah.\nDan Walsh: but that's basically a bastardization of images, So what people are doing right now is they're taking an AI model and they're basically doing a container file that just does a copy of the AI model into an image. So instead now you have a massive file. instead of having a massive file, you have a tied up massive file and you lose the ability to do certain things in it or really what happens is everybody's sort of developing their own way of doing it. so right now everybody's using OCI images with just single files in them and the goal of artifacts is to not have to do that mechanism. Yeah.\nBrent Baude: Yeah, I think Dan,\u2026\nBrent Baude: I'm trying to avoid tagging because it certainly complicates things. I think if in the end use cases bear that out, we'll have to cross that bridge. and we may already be on that bridge. but for now, no. Yep.\nDan Walsh: Yeah. can I push from A to B?\nDan Walsh: So yes, because I'm thinking more around if I create an artifact that is labeled latest and\u2026\nTom Sweeney: f***.\nDan Walsh: Als I also want to have it labeled as 5.0 go to have two labels to the same artifact so that's\u2026\nDan Walsh: where I'm seeing because certain people are going to want to freeze on a certain version of the artifact and then there'll be newer versions of the artifact coming along I think\u2026\n00:25:00\nBrent Baude: I think it's a fair ask that when we push we can name a destination that's different.\nBrent Baude: Yes. Yep.\nDan Walsh: if you had that that would probably eliminate the need for tagging\nBrent Baude: Any other questions? So, we'll kick her back to Tom and move along. Wait. Mhm.\nTom Sweeney: over to Paul to talk about NetVark 1.14 new features that are coming up. Take it away, Paul.\nPaul Holzinger: Okay, you should see my terminal. so this is showcasing a few features that were added and most of them were actually contributed by community contributors. So many thanks to them. just showing them off here. So it's not all my work.  And so first of all just to give you an overview of the system here.\nPaul Holzinger: so I have a bridge and I have the normal Ethernet device connected to that bridge and so I want all my traffic going through this bridge basically and connected to my containers and before that so today the bridge code in net always assumed we create our own separate bridge and then do  masquerading and DNET and stuff for all the traffic and now it's a bit different but the first thing I want to show is some DHCP change where we sent the container host name to the DHCP server. So traditionally DHCP only worked on MC VLAN. So I'm just showing real quick MC van example.\nPaul Holzinger: So if you now run this, I of course didn't enable the unit. Lovely life demos, aren't it? That's fun. That happens when you reboot before you do your stuff. So all right but the start should now perfect. So now you have the usual DHCP. So this is in the network the same as the VM on the bridge also. And you can see in the locks from the DHCP server.\nPaul Holzinger: So DNS MQ on my host. we got the host name here. So if you have your average home router or any advanced router with graphical interfaces, they have some form of showing you the host names from the DHCP request and then you can actually understand which IP is owned by what device and not just see the MAC addresses which are randomly generated for container.  So that was a bit annoying to work with and now you just have the host name and that's much better. And then there was to the bridge driver a new mode added. It's called unmanaged. So if you have the command you the opt mode unmanaged.\nPaul Holzinger: And what that does is basically disables our management of the bridge how we think we do it with the masquerading and the nut and instead we don't create firewall rules. We just assume it's an existing bridge that must exist.  So I'm using the BR0 bridge from M host and then you just create the network with that and it will sort of just directly attach it like most VM manager would handle it. So now the network is created and I just run a container on it and I list the rule set. So right now it's a bit these are all firewall D rules.\nPaul Holzinger: So you can ignore them. But at the bottom usually if you do it in the normal way you get the netavark table with our new NF tables driver and there are no firewall rules at all needed because you're directly connected to a bridge that is directly bridged to some external interface. so it can look at the interfaces. Now you have the web pair for the container.  So the one part is attached to the bridge and the other part is in the container. so let's remove these networks. And now you can combine that with the HCP. So the current version just used the hardcoded IPs which are the default just the subnet range that is a site normally.\n00:30:00\nPaul Holzinger: But now I'm requesting the IPM driver DHCP and that is now very similar to the MAC van which was the first example but what we only did before and with that created so I start a container and I can exit to show the IP addresses. again from my local network connectivity is also working. It pulls the gateway from the DHCP server. and yeah it's again just some web pair assigned and attached. And with that you now have this bridge driver working similar to McVan.\nPaul Holzinger: The main difference why you would want to use bridge is if you have an existing bridge setup with virtual machines or for whatever reason then you can have your containers via the same setup and then all the devices can talk over the bridge and the bridge also is the bridge IP exists on the host and you can talk to the host system which is not possible via MCVAN because McVlan  in the kernel. it's special that it bypasses the host network and that also means it bypasses host network firewall rules and routing policies that exist there and it's good straight to the MC through the McVin interface. and with bridge the bridge is on the host.\nPaul Holzinger: So these are the main two difference why you would want to use bridge and if you need that that depends totally on what you want to do. for most people make van works fine and There's another new feature which is VLAN support for the bridge. So you can have two networks with VLAN assigned.  So it would look like I don't have a working demo here because I didn't manage to get the VLAN on my bridge interface correctly working without killing my SSH connection before the demo. but I can show you how it looks really quick.\nPaul Holzinger: So you do again the network create and then you again want to combine this with the mode unmanaged and then you just say op vlan and then you use your number that you want to use for this network.  So I don't know Ver number 10 and then I just call the network Ver number 10 and say the bridge interface name BR.\nPaul Holzinger: So yeah that would look something like that for the net config and then you would run it in the same way but if I do it that it doesn't work on that bridge but in the end so if you do bridge van show unfortunately I don't have it working you would have the website assigned to the other van ID basically from the ports\nPaul Holzinger: And what you can do is basically on the same bridge so PR0 you can create another network for van 20 and so on and then you would have all the different vans on the same bridge which if you have physical networks and need this vain separation through the subnet that might be of use for that So, I'm probably going to write a small blog about these features and then I will hopefully have a working van example to show there. And with that, any questions?\nTom Sweeney: I just have a quick one on the VLAN support. Is that expected to land 54 fully?\nPaul Holzinger: That is all expected or that's all merged.\nPaul Holzinger: It's in Portman 54 and Netherwalk 1.14. All these features together\n00:35:00\nTom Sweeney: Any other questions? With that, I will thank Paul a nice demo and we will move on to our last topic of the day or not last topic but our last demo of the day and have Castto Ellerman show us about personal multi session containers and CN nest. Go ahead.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: Thank you. Let me share my window.\nTom Sweeney: Thanks for coming.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: Oops. One second. So I I guess give some background first. thanks for having me show this. is the size look okay as far as text size?\nDan Walsh: Yep.\nTom Sweeney: Yep.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: So just for some background on C nest the kind of starting point was I would say a decade ago I would s SSH from my Mac laptop into local Linux VMs.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: So when containers came around that was super exciting to do something bit better and when podman came around I was super excited about podman rather than using docker for many reasons. cest originally started out as a monolithic python utility kind of similar to toolbox. It was inspired by toolbox but at the time toolbox was not something I wanted to use for a variety of reasons. it was pod that this utility in its old form was largely motivated by shortcomings of podman. And last year I did a massive revamp of this utility because podman has advanced so much and basically made most of what I had written obsolete. So I wanted to give kudos to the podman team to basically slowly been adding functionality that made my original script less and less necessary.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: So what the script is now is really mainly a guide and some starter bash scripts because I really figured out that the vast majority of functionality could be done by just a thin layer of bash scripts on top of existing podband functionality. so the website or this guide is it's in the notes cest. and it's mainly talking about how to use Podman. but it also, has an RPM package where you can start out with these two scripts.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: in terms of a little bit of background for this presentation, I'm partly motivated because I'm curious what other people do or to the extent that other people are using local containers and actually doing development inside the containers. over the past 10 years, I've been somewhat surprised that I don't know, just something that else has come along. so I find myself still kind of using these scripts on top of podband which and toolbox has become very much a tool that integrates very tightly which is actually isolation is one of the things that I like doing development.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: and I'm also mildly curious as quickly whether anyone has heard people using the term hosttop hoptop. because that is often how I've been identifying the operating system that's not containerized. as far as the functionality that I'm going to demo next and kind of the core functional because there are a lot of bells and whistles that are thrown into these bash scripts and what I'm going to show but at the core level or the key traits is that the containers are not ephemeral. They're not immediately auto removed and they're also not long-term permanent containers. I get it.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: It seems that a lot of users that are doing toolbox are really using containers as a long-term like they're holding on these things for a year or two and at least for my usage scenario they're very much not permanent but they're also not auto remove so they're persistent and that your isolated changes that you might be doing are staying in the container not immediately getting removed but eventually I stop using them and my containers probably live it kind of depends on the project what I'm doing but they generally\nE. Castedo Ellerman: live maybe months but generally they're not the permanent because I use container files or docker files with builda to actually make what's permanent some of I guess toolbox the other key thing is that I switch between doing development on debian based distros and red based ones so even though my laptop is on red hat I'm often, flipping back and forth between doing development and the command line on totally different distros, which is one of the things I love about containers. and then at least for my scenario, I know a lot of users don't seem to want this or they want lots of integration. That's actually one of the things I liked about Podman it's isolated first and so I like this aspect of having partial isolation and partial integration.\n00:40:00\nE. Castedo Ellerman: Yeah, Dan,\u2026\nE. Castedo Ellerman: your hand is raised.\nDan Walsh: Yeah. \u2026\nDan Walsh: do you have to make a human decision when you want to auto to remove an image or I mean not a container do you have tooling to help you that list a container I haven't used in the last month two months\nE. Castedo Ellerman: For the most part, I'm trying to use Builda and Podman as much as possible. So separately I'm not showing it here but I have kind of a setup for building images that's actually continue integration with GitLab but it could be locally but whatever however someone is building images this is kind of independent of that and this is more once you have images then how are you kind of creating these medium-term containers. I don't\u2026\nDan Walsh: Okay.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: if that answered your question.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: at least in this guide I just suggest people use podman ps and I don't do anything fancy. I also have this little trivial script that pitifies and shows things in a certain way but I'll show u what it looks like. and if anyone has questions feel free to interrupt. I won't get thrown off. so that was the last thing.  So, let me quickly show so what you're looking at right now is my hosttop or the non-containerized environment and I rely on a little bit of embellishment of having the icons to know where I am on a typical situation is I'm running one of these wrapper scripts which it's maybe 80 lines it is part of this RPM that the\nE. Castedo Ellerman: guide suggests, but it's really trivy enough that I imagine most people would just, want to copy it and integrate it into their own scripts. But this CS is really just a wrapper to calling Podman. But in my typical usage, I have a couple of containers that I'm, hopping into. One of them is development on Fedora.  So I'll run C nest and I'll drop in to a container environment that has some visual indication that I'm in a different container. one of the details is that I like is that I choose not to have so much integration that my entire home drive is shared.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: So, this home drive has less crap in it than say when I'm back at my hosttop, where I have, much more stuff I should do do all, much stuff going on. and so depending on the env in the container, so there I've got another one that's I use for building packages, it'll be much, more minimal. so that's an example of, these different degrees of isolation that at least and I also somewhat curious to what extent people seek that degree of ol it's ugly message. as in terms of listing the containers u so typically more or less what I do I have a script that makes it a little bit nicer to look at is I'm just doing psall.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: So I'll have containers. They might be running, they Doesn't matter. I'll just ps and so you can see I've got these containers that have been around for a while. what was the and I should mention that you'll notice that none of them are currently running.  So even though I enter a container so I'm in this container and now if I go to a different window and I do ps all you can see that container has been up for 7 seconds. the script cleans up. So it automatically logs out. and now you can see that the container is no longer running.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: So it does a little bit of accounting just to kind of but for the most part one of the things that I found I was always kind of working around was this awkwardness of whether containers are running or not when really what I'm going for is multi-session being able to have multiple terminal windows and be able to jump in and jump out of the container with its separate semiisolated environment for development. so that covers C nest there's a lot of bells and\u2026\n00:45:00\nE. Castedo Ellerman: whistles. you know what question?\nDan Walsh: is in CDS do you have some kind of special configuration file I mean when you saw your limited home directory there those are bind mounts from the home directory or\u2026\nDan Walsh: volume mounts from the home directory in  Okay.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: Yes. Yeah.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: So one of actually let me answer that question after I show the other bash script that's basically a wrapper for build odman create. So CS is basically just a wrapper for podman run or actually exec now that I think about it it's a wrapper for podman exec. because if you notice the command that's running in the background is always sleep in.  So, these containers these personal multi-session containers, they're just always sleep in the background with a couple of settings so that it's just quietly running in the background if it hasn't been cleaned up.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: one other nice thing with this bash script is if you are jumping into a container from a directory that's shared it's smart enough know to stay in it. So for instance right now I'm in a source off my home drive. If I jump into this container I'm still in the source subdirectory.  So that med makes a lot more convenient hopping between the hosttop and one of these containers and that if you're in a subdirectory that's shared you don't have to constantly be cding back into that directory. and there are other bells and whistles.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: as far as configuration and how did those, only part of the home drive show up, something that I ended up kind of settling on for the other script, it's called create seest and it's largely a wrapper of podman create. but what I found is if the image is done as the first part of the parameter.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: So, Podman has a bit of this what I found awkwardness in the command line and that you have lots and lots of options almost at the end you then have the image and then you have potentially a command and what I found with this wrapper script is that because of autocomp completion if the image is at the beginning it makes it very conducive to having wrapper scripts that then just tack on options on the end and I end up  wrapping these scripts and doing configuration by just adding things in and by having the image be first it makes it easy to have autocomp completion set up.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: So for instance, what I'm going to show here is using the podman on Quay the Podman image, but with all the configuration goodness that kind of like. I'm going to start out running this create C nest without a lot of configuration. but I'm going to do tab completion now. And you can see I'm getting all the images that are on my machine.  And one thing that I've really liked is so for inance I'll start typing quay and I'll do tab and it'll complete it podman stable. So right now because the image is the very first thing on the command line it's easy to get the autocomp completion set up and have the nice features of podband but in a much simpler wrapper script that doesn't require all this extra stuff.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: So yes yeah when the container is created the command is sleep in.\nDan Walsh: So that's to do that, right? Yeah.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: So it's basically always sleep in. So as long as the container has sleep in it's basically happy.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: And then when I run the wrapper script c nest is I think it's doing bin bash I can't yeah and I'm exeing in yeah exactly so a very typical workflow is I'll do create nest I'll grab some image often these images are continuous integration images that I've built that I'm using both for kind of local developments and also using them in a continuous inter integration environment\nDan Walsh: That's what you're expecting the command at that point.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: So, one thing that I've kind of liked is not having the requirement of starting with a base that has a bunch of extra stuff in it. I start with images that are just kind of bare bones. and then maybe add on a few other things, but a lot of the personalization is getting added on the fly by this create seest. So, I'm going to do podman and I'm going to tack on a name. I can add other things. what's nice is that because these are getting added on the end I may not do a volume. all these options that usually go to podman create I can just tack on over and over again. and I found that very very nice for wrapper scripts.\n00:50:00\nE. Castedo Ellerman: So I'm going to show just a base level create C nest here where I'm creating potty. I'm going to now c nest into this potty that I named potty. And it's got basically nothing because I haven't added anything. let me see if I can do this on the fly. I could have added a volume where I said I see source home. See if I can do this quickly enough.  And I need to give it a different name. So this one I just tapped on a volume, on the command line. and so now when I go in, you can see it actually detected that the source subdirectory is shared. And so it's just popped me down into source in the container. but now I've got, this subdirectory that I shared as a volume is now in that container.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: and it automatically detects that if I'm in that subdirectory on the hosttop htop when I c nest in it detects that I'm there and puts me in that subdirectory. So it's been very convenient. the last thing I'll show is the wrapping of create cest and that's partly because the image is at the beginning is I have various different configurations.  So right now I've gone into a subdirectory on my hosttop with a variety of wrappers of this wrapper script. depending on the environment. So for instance if I want to use one of my development settings I will get all the yummy goodness of autocomp completion because it's called C nest.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: So if I tab complete, I can still get all these containers. it's so this script is actually just a wrapper calling create CNS and it's adding on a bunch of volumes and extra configuration. Answer Dan your question. it's just tacking on the end all these extra things that I want when I'm going into my own container on the end.  And so now I get this nice combination of autocomp completion where I can say, quay podman latest. I can just tack on, a different name pod awesome. I could add on some more things. but because I'm going to call this wrapper script, it just is tacking on all these things.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: this container has been created with all the users and what I I call this pod awesome and so now I have all this extra stuff that's in there but this is actually the base of it is the podman stable container image so the container image is I pulled it off it it has very few assumptions it did not assume anything about the user ID I'm actually coming in as a completely different user ID but it's actually the  user, that I'm on the system. So, I can, write things to the hosttop. oops. so I think that's basically it.\nTom Sweeney: Yeah, you hate Russ getting\nE. Castedo Ellerman: So yeah so my main big question is\u2026\nE. Castedo Ellerman: what do other people have kind of isolated environments? do most people do development kind of on the hosttop in the non-containerized environment? is if anyone does do development actually inside the containers would they just do kind of raw podman or wing their own shell scripts or use I guess maybe some fancy gooey I don't know\nDan Walsh: So one thing you're not using right now that we added to pod man is the concept of modules. I don't know if are you familiar with modules. So what modules is basically you probably know what a containers.com file is right basically you're able to modify the way podman works. so what modules do is allow you to specify a specific containers.com file for the container you're going to create. and one of the things for instance you were showing that your scripts have sort of hard-coded volume mounts that you're putting into them.\n00:55:00\nDan Walsh: You could create a containers.com file that would list out the common source directory and SSH directory or whatever you want to volume out into your containers. And instead of having to have individual scripts, you could have, the equivalent of podman odule equals standard volumes or something like that and it would automatically mount those volumes. so now you could have a name for your standard configuration and\u2026\nDan Walsh: you could do everything you just did with modules and then I don't know just if auto so contain so modules inherit from each other so they would nest \u2026\nE. Castedo Ellerman: And can you include these into each other?\nE. Castedo Ellerman: I mean as far as nesting so having a base configuration. okay.\nDan Walsh: but if you put volumes in one I think there is a syntax plus equals volumes. Anyways, the people who doing that caught us to do that was HBC world. so this is a lot of government agencies that are doing really really complex podman commands for their users do that. the way they're doing usually it's like I have this I want all my users to run the same podman command\u2026\nDan Walsh: but it has 45 options on it so now they consolidate all those options into a single modules it can be used with create yeah so it's something I would definitely look into\u2026\nE. Castedo Ellerman: And is that for podman run or\u2026\nE. Castedo Ellerman: can it be used with create? okay. Yeah.\nDan Walsh: because it might I don't know if I haven't probably about maybe a year ago.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: When did that go into Podman? So, I probably should update the guide to talk about or\u2026\nDan Walsh: And\u2026\nE. Castedo Ellerman: I should start using them and\u2026\nDan Walsh: I would look at it\u2026\nE. Castedo Ellerman: update the guide.\nDan Walsh: because it can do things like I mean you could set pretty much any option you want. and so if you're currently doing everything along the lines of podman commands, - security opt equals,\u2026\nE. Castedo Ellerman: Yeah. okay.\nDan Walsh: sec disabled or whatever. then you could put that into a configuration file and then just use that configuration file as something standard.  But it's actually for exactly the use case that you're doing where you want these complic I like the idea of the thin down home directory. So the most people that similar to this are using obviously toolkit. So that's probably our biggest user of longlasting containers but the HPC was looking into again modules.com for similar page toolbox.\nDan Walsh: Sorry, did I say toolbox. the other area that I've been interested in is podman shell, which is basically lockdown shells that stick users in and what we're using there for is quadlets. So, the other area where will become interesting is basically defining a quadlet as a mechanism for defining what the user environment is going to be when user success into it. I kind of like that. I think you have some interesting ideas for setting up these type of environments. my only thing is you must have to deal with a huge amount of containers that you're always getting and\u2026\nDan Walsh: destroying and things like that.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: Yeah. Yeah.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: It's probably I sometimes think I'm going a bit crazy with containers and creating lots of them. So yeah, it does seem sometimes it's getting a bit crazy, but yeah, is I think I may be creating and destroying the same profile or there are certain kind of job roles and I'll use different containers on the job role, but I'm probably destroying one some of these maybe every few weeks. I'll be\nE. Castedo Ellerman: Yeah.\nDan Walsh: So, you're doing a rename but if the container is running, you're going to stop it, restart it, that type of thing, right?\nE. Castedo Ellerman: Yeah, they're usually not running that often. I mean, it's easy to stop. There's not much to stopping them, but yeah, I do rename. And to be honest, that when that feature went into Podman, that really improved my workflow a lot because I was doing all kinds of workarounds and extra scripting to work around this limitation of not renaming.\n01:00:00\nE. Castedo Ellerman: so yeah, and you may have noticed that I actually had a container there that was called dev.ld because that was, what I had before and it was kind of gotten all dirty but yeah, I use rename. Yes.\nTom Sweeney: wrap this up only because we're past time at this point in time. So, are there any more questions or comments here?\nDan Walsh: to build then I think that would be please suggest them.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: Yeah. Yeah. after I update modules, I'll try to I feel like there's been a nice trend where all this stuff that I wrapped is getting more and more obsolete as Podman does more and more stuff. So, I'm more than happy to help contribute to that obsolescence.\nDan Walsh: Excellent. All right.\nE. Castedo Ellerman: All right. Thank you very much. Thanks.\nTom Sweeney: Thank you,\u2026\nTom Sweeney: It was great little talk and great demo as Okay, I'm going to skip over forms questions. If anybody has any, please let us know offline. We don't have any topics currently for the next meeting, which will be in two months in April. love to have something there if you have any thoughts there. And our next meeting again will be go fulling April Fool's Day, April 1st, 2025 again at 11 am. And our next cabal meeting is coming up on Tuesday,\u2026\nNeil Smith: Thanks everyone.\nTom Sweeney: March 4th.\nBrent Baude: Yep. Thank you.\nTom Sweeney: So with that, I am going to thank everybody for coming, especially the presenters, and I'm going to stop recording.\nGerry Seidman: Thank you.\n")))}vr.isMDXComponent=!0;const Ir={},Mr="Podman Community Cabal Meeting Notes",Sr=[{value:"March 4, 2025 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-5)",id:"march-4-2025-1100-am-eastern-utc-5",level:2},{value:"Attendees",id:"attendees",level:3},{value:"March 4, 2025 Topics",id:"march-4-2025-topics",level:3},{value:"Meeting Notes",id:"meeting-notes",level:3},{value:"CNCF Governance - Matt Heon - (0:42 in the video)",id:"cncf-governance---matt-heon---042-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Better ways to build images - Zack Zlotnik- (5:25 in the video)",id:"better-ways-to-build-images---zack-zlotnik--525-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"CNCF Update - Neil Smith - (: in the video) - 15",id:"cncf-update---neil-smith----in-the-video---15",level:4},{value:"Backlog Management  - Neil Smith - (16:55 in the video)",id:"backlog-management----neil-smith---1655-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Open discussion - (33:10 in the video)",id:"open-discussion---3310-in-the-video",level:4},{value:"Next Cabal Meeting: Tuesday, May 6, 2025, 11:00 a.m. EDT (UTC-4)",id:"next-cabal-meeting-tuesday-may-6-2025-1100-am-edt-utc-4",level:3},{value:"Possible Topics",id:"possible-topics",level:4},{value:"Next Community Meeting: Tuesday, April 1, 2025, 11:00 a.m. EST (UTC-4)",id:"next-community-meeting-tuesday-april-1-2025-1100-am-est-utc-4",level:3},{value:"Possible Topics:",id:"possible-topics-1",level:4},{value:"Raw Meeting Chat:",id:"raw-meeting-chat",level:3},{value:"Raw Google Meet Transcript",id:"raw-google-meet-transcript",level:3}],Tr={toc:Sr},Ar="wrapper";function Br(e){let{components:t,...n}=e;return(0,Ne.kt)(Ar,(0,ce.Z)({},Tr,n,{components:t,mdxType:"MDXLayout"}),(0,Ne.kt)("h1",{id:"podman-community-cabal-meeting-notes"},"Podman Community Cabal Meeting Notes"),(0,Ne.kt)("h2",{id:"march-4-2025-1100-am-eastern-utc-5"},"March 4, 2025 11:00 a.m. Eastern (UTC-5)"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"attendees"},"Attendees"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Ashley Cui, Brent Baude, Gerry Seidman, Giuseppe Scrivano, James Cassell, Jan Rodak, Kevin Clevenger, Lokesh Mandvekar, Mario Loriedo, Mark Russell, Matt Heon, Miloslav Trmac, Mohan Boddu, Nalin Dahyabhai, Neil Smith, Nicola Sella, Paul Holzinger, Tom Sweeney, Zack Zlotnik"),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"march-4-2025-topics"},"March 4, 2025 Topics"),(0,Ne.kt)("ol",null,(0,Ne.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"CNCF Governance - Matt Heon"),(0,Ne.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Better ways to build images - Zack Zlotnik"),(0,Ne.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"CNCF Update - Neil Smith"),(0,Ne.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Backlog Management - Neil Smith")),(0,Ne.kt)("h3",{id:"meeting-notes"},"Meeting Notes"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Video ",(0,Ne.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfDmgNFaX2I"},"Recording")),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Meeting start 11:02 a.m. EDT (UTC-5) Tuesday, March 4, 2025"),(0,Ne.kt)("h4",{id:"cncf-governance---matt-heon---042-in-the-video"},"CNCF Governance - Matt Heon - (0:42 in the video)"),(0,Ne.kt)("p",null,"Governance PR: ",(0,Ne.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/25398"},"https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/25398"),".

Welcome to the pond man community cabal meeting. Today is Tuesday, March 4th, 2025. Today we have four topics to talk about. a lot of them are to deal with the new upcoming CNCF change that we're having with our projects. First one off the bat there will be Matt Han talking about CNCF governance. Then we'll have Zach and Zach I'm going to butcher your name I'm sure is Lotnik. Am I close?\nZack Zlotnik: That's it. Yeah.\nTom Sweeney: He'll be talking about better ways to build images and then Neil Smith will have a general CNCF update where we're going and then Neil will also follow that up with a backlog management. So with that all said I'm going to hand it over to Matt\nMatt Heon: Okay, so this one should be relatively quick. I will start off by assuming Google meet lets me meet, linking the pull request and sharing so we are now working on our governance model for CNCF. This basically is going to decide how the project is going to function from here on out.  Now that we are in the CNCF, this designates things such as what the roles of our maintainers are, how things work within the project, how we add code, etc., etc. And generally speaking, if anyone wants to become involved with the project, this designates how they're going to be able to do that. How you can get promoted to a code reviewer and then a maintainer and then a more senior core maintainer who has voting rights on project related decisions.\nMatt Heon: Anyways, this is all up on GitHub. I have linked the PR. It's still preliminary, not merged, etc. suggest we are taking suggestions from anyone who has them. My goal would be to get a draft version of this merged into the repository either late this week or early next week.  and then we'll continue accepting comments and pull requests against it for a period of several more weeks before we call it not draft anymore and start enforcing the actual rules. So I would say by late March we would be having this in force. yeah, there's a lot in here. It's something like 250 lines I believe. So I won't go over every part of it.\nMatt Heon: just wanted to link it and let people review it If you don't care how the product project is run and especially if you don't feel you're like you want to become a maintainer, you'd have no obligation to review this. But if you do want to become a maintainer in the future, this will be very useful for you.  All right, I think that's about it for\nTom Sweeney: Any questions for Matt?\nBrent Baude: Matt, people do listen to these recordings, do you want to highlight how you have sort of specked out the notion of core maintainers, reviewers, and maybe just some of the privileges?\nBrent Baude: I know they can go read that, but maybe you can break it down quickly.\nMatt Heon: Fair enough.\nMatt Heon: So we start off with what we call A reviewer is basically just assisting in code review. you can become a reviewer by co reviewing code for a while and eventually the project maintainers will nominate you to be a reviewer or even ask to be nominated and then once you have been nominated and accepted you gain the ability to approve pull requests as in mark them as being reviewed but not to merge pull requests. Next step up is a Maintainers have the ability to actually merge pull requests on a single repository. All maintainers will be drawn from reviewers.\nMatt Heon: So if you've been a reviewer for a period of time and you're doing good work, you can ask to be nominated as a maintainer and once you become a maintainer, you gain the ability to merge code on that repo and also to attend maintainer meetings, although you do not have a vote on project governance at that point. Next step up from that is core maintainer. So we have a bunch of repos in the  Podman, Builder and Scopio have all been donated and in recognition of the fact that they have very different requirements, very different roles. we have a core maintainer function which is basically people who have the knowledge and experience to govern the whole project i.e. they know how all of our projects work together and things of that Core maintainers are drawn from maintainers. After a period of experience as a maintainer and doing a good job there, you can become a core maintainer.\nMatt Heon: or maintainers get actual votes on how the project runs going forward. And then on top of that, we have a community manager role which is sort of ancillary. That's going to be people\u2026\nMatt Heon: who help us maintain the community, run meetings like this, etc. And I think that's about everything.\nTom Sweeney: Can I ask the origin?\nTom Sweeney: Did you base this off a CNCF template of sorts and\u2026\n00:05:00\nTom Sweeney: take it from there?\nMatt Heon: Yes, this is a heavily modified version of\u2026\nMatt Heon: what CNCF calls the contributor ladder. we added a few rolls they don't have and remove some that they have that we don't\nTom Sweeney: Any other questions for Hearing none, I'm going to say thank you, Matt.\nTom Sweeney: And we will ask Zach to go ahead and talk to us about better ways to build images.\nZack Zlotnik: Hey folks. without going into it too much I like so I'm part of the machine config operator MCO team that works on that open shift component.  And so one of the things that we do is we do OS configuration and with image mode we've been kind of looking at we're now tasked with building an OS image and there's some conditionals that we had to think about if do this thing or do this other thing and really the only solution that we were able to come up with that worked was templatizing a container file\nZack Zlotnik: And this whole process got me thinking of, is there a better way to do this? is there kind of a better way to kind of think about this?  And I believe me when I say that I read so much code in the build and podman repos and everything in containers just to try to get some inspiration for kind of a better way to do things. And last week I did a presentation at the containerization guild gathering basically called building containers programmatically.\nZack Zlotnik: I'm not going to go into it too much just because I don't want to waste everyone's time, but the general gist of my idea that was that Builda itself has quite a number of APIs that you can use even if there's a lot of knobs and dials there and that's just  a consequence of how complex this stuff really is. And it made me think that, maybe we could build some higher level abstractions on top of it. I don't know what it could look like. I did kind of a code sketch if you will. I can share it if you like.\nZack Zlotnik: It was I'll just share the samples that I did for the wait what is hang on oops won't let me share says I don't have permission but that's okay the idea that I had was just having some better building blocks that we could put together and in speaking\nZack Zlotnik: about this with Jonathan Leon. I'm not sure if he's here or not. I know that they have some particular use cases around chunking image layers and chunking things into there. I don't want to misspeak and kind of misdefine that particular problem. but just in general I just kind of wanted to get an idea I just wanted to get an idea over whether this is something that we should maybe explore a little bit just kind of experiment with. just to be clear I'm not looking to replace container files.\nZack Zlotnik: I don't think that somebody should have to write a program in order to build a container image and I don't see something like this being built into either Podman or Builda, but those tools could be used as kind of a foundation for something else. So I will leave it at that for right now. I would share my screen, but it said something about permissions, so that's okay.\nBrent Baude: Tom, are you aware of why he can't share his screen?\nTom Sweeney: No, I'm not. Unless it's a Google Docs,\u2026\nTom Sweeney: some kind of perm.\nZack Zlotnik: Yeah. I don't know what's going on with that.\n00:10:00\nZack Zlotnik: It worked before.\nTom Sweeney: Before we started the recording, we did a test.\nZack Zlotnik: Yeah. Yeah, it Could be my computer because could just be having a bad day.\nNeil Smith: Do you want to send Tom a link and\u2026\nNeil Smith: he can share?\nZack Zlotnik: Yeah, Yeah, let me see if I can just link to just this slide here. I don't want to There it is. I'll just drop it here for now. I don't know if that slide's going to come up. This is the one thing that I just want to point out with this is that this is just me just writing proof of concept code. And really all it does is it just spits out a container file that has steps in it. You can compose them any way you want. I'm not saying that that's the approach that one should take.\nZack Zlotnik: instead it's just kind of an idea that okay, we can create building blocks on top on top of things or on top of this that can do that that would know for example, one of the ideas I had was this idea of just kind of a generic package installer that takes a list of package names, and a final image tag and knows what to do with it. it would know if the base image uses RPMOS tree or uses DNF. It would know how to resolve package names. it would know how to do a bunch of different things along those lines. And that's just one example of kind of the building block. I can see some other examples as well.\nZack Zlotnik: I kind of wish I would have shown that in this presentation, but I was in a bit of a time crunch to get everything put together for it.\nNeil Smith: Are you asking if you can put something in front of the build to produce a batch of container images?\nZack Zlotnik: Not necessarily that because I've read the API docs. I know that it has quite a rich API that one could use to do that. In fact, I've kind of done it following the example that was there.\nZack Zlotnik: more what about more what I'm thinking about is this idea of having building blocks for container images that doesn't necessarily require one to write a container file.  I mean, they can if they want, but I see it is as more of a way to have more control over the build process.\nZack Zlotnik: Let me see if Jonathan can join because he Jonathan certainly had some ideas around chunking and things like that that I want to make sure that yeah,\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Do you want to pause this talk for the moment and we'll go on to the next one?\nZack Zlotnik: go ahead. we can pause it.\nTom Sweeney: See what we can get Jonathan so next up that we had CNF update Neil.\nNeil Smith: Okay, just share my screen.\nTom Sweeney: Oops. I'll stop Yes.\nNeil Smith: So this is the CNCF update part first. Okay. as part of we got accepted to Sandbox in January and the next thing we're working on is onboarding ourselves into the CNCF. So here's the official one and we have created a copy so that we can edit it so now you can see what we're at.\nNeil Smith: So this inside of Podman has an issue called CNCF onboard tracking. We are underway. the big thing that we're waiting for is CNC have to change some of their agreements in the contribution agreement. So Red Hat Legal is looking over that to make sure that they're still okay with it.  But as everybody knows that takes a little bit of time. and then we are going through and marking these things as done. The big one that Matt already talked about is the governance.\n00:15:00\nNeil Smith: And then one of the main other things that we are waiting for the legal agreement says is then we will send over all of our images and artwork to the CNCF. we will be moving some of our communication platforms over to a Slack workspace.  That's where CNCF does their communications. we will be transferring our website domain over to the CNCF for ownership and Matt was also talking about this and that was some of the issues.\nNeil Smith: we will be putting together our maintainer list and adding it to the aggregated maintainer list and that's pretty much almost all of it. So, basically waiting on legal and then we'll have a big push through for some of these things to happen in terms of, sending over artwork and\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Sure.\nNeil Smith: and the other, ownership pieces that Red Hat still has. And then we will start the work on moving into Any questions?  Great. I'll just move on to the next thing.  What I wanted to talk about with the community is we were doing some analysis on the amount of open PRs and open issues and their growth in the repositories we sort of care about.\nNeil Smith: So These are looking at the following itories. Artvark builda common conmon conman rs container se Linux crun image and podman pi scobio and storage. we did some analysis and one of the things that we saw was and this is on how long things are open is that for some old issues we have some old issues. So 50% of our issues are not that old.\nNeil Smith: Okay, 24 days is the oldest one in the 50 percentile in Scopio. But as we get into 75 percentile and max, we have quite a few very old items that have been just sitting around forever. If we look at this graph, this is our growth in open issues as time goes by.  So, in 2022, we had about, 450 items open, right?\nNeil Smith: ice issues and we've had a huge growth in items that are staying open until right now that whenever I took this data we have around 1100 or 1150 open issues PRs aren't quite as bad but we have about 190 open PRs what I  was wanting to discuss is what do people think about this? Do we think we need to start looking at things that have been around for a long time and marking them as closed won't fix because of date?\nNeil Smith: or what should we do with these ancient items and trying to get our backlog back in control in a way which without leaving these things open forever or does the community want us to leave those things open forever? That's what I was going to ask  Any opinions, right?\n00:20:00\nBrent Baude: All right, I'll bite. I think I've said this before, but maybe it gets conversation going. What I have heard is that our team have been the ones that want to keep them open because there's been a belief that at some point we're take care of them. I think the reality has set in with 700 issues at least on one of those repos that's probably not working and\u2026\nNeil Smith: Yeah.\nBrent Baude: is contributing a lot of noise to the ability to be able to manage a backlog. So that's kind of for me one of the questions that I would ask the team to contemplate and others which would doing a mass purge based on something help us manage our backlog.\nBrent Baude: Not because we reduced it because then we have less to look around for.\nNeil Smith: The one thing that's my opinion is\u2026\nNeil Smith: if we're really not going to be doing something with an issue, if we keep it open, you end up looking at it repeatedly and spending time on something that is basically waste of time. So, that's what I'm hoping. we all have limited time. So, if we do make a decision, we should also have a policy of let's just get this out of the way so we don't have to see it again. All your hands up\nPaul Holzinger: So I find the term backlog maybe not very fitting to upstream issues. it's not a backlog. It's a list of whatever users reported and\u2026\nNeil Smith: Right. Right.\nPaul Holzinger: to the largest extents these are bugs that actually exist. If they weren't existing and we would have closed many. Of course, that includes a bunch of limbo state stuff where we have no idea is this some random environment failure or is there actually something in the program code, right? these are the hard things whether you want to close them or not.\nPaul Holzinger: But I believe a vast majority of things will stay open because they are valid bugs. And just randomly closing them in hopes they are not reported again is kind of pointless and it won't reduce work because they will be reported again and then somebody else reads the same bug report again which doesn't really help that much in my opinion.\nPaul Holzinger: So I'm thinking if the goal is to lower the number, that's for me not what I worry about. what's the number? I don't\nNeil Smith: I guess my goal is not to just lower the number.\nNeil Smith: It's more about one thing is the people are the community the users are saying hey I found something and then we're keeping it open forever even though we looked at it and at some point in time know that we're not going to do anything with it.\nNeil Smith: I think if I was a user, I'd rather you just told me you're not going to do anything with it.\nPaul Holzinger: To be know that at this point it's difficult.\nPaul Holzinger: Yeah. let's go to stuff.\nNeil Smith: I mean I can understand if we looked at it and it's like this is probably an issue we should look into and we let it sit around but obviously wasn't urgent enough. So it sat there for 3 years at some point in time. Should you not say we're never going to look at this? Right. I don't know.  Melisoft.\nMiloslav Trmac: Yeah, I passed to the expected benefit. if I basically look at the old ones during the buck weeks, which means once a quarter and it's just skimming the titles which I try to keep updated.  So that runs to zero cost and there would be no efficiency benefit from closing them. otherwise if we talk about bugs I'm ambivalent there is still the fact that some user took the time to write that down and it might be valuable in itself and closing it is just throwing that away.\n00:25:00\nMiloslav Trmac: on the other hand setting expectations we are sorry we can't get to it maybe you can help there might be some value for it for closing feature requests I would be fairly strongly opposed because they frequently contain some clarification discussion context and I mean what's the benefit of closing that if we have a canonical place for this is this idea that might get done someday we've been thinking  about that for five years. It's not likely to get done, but still it's a good pointer to that idea. And if we close feature requests and instead start maintaining a text file road map, that's not better.\nMatt Heon: It sounds like the ultimate question here really is it more frustrating for a user to find a bug that is closed without a solution or that has remained open for the last 3 years without a solution. I have always been on the leave it open side of things. saying that the bug is still a bug, but we don't have the ability to work on it and fix it has always been my preference. I agree with Mil Slop on RFS though. should leave F open generally speaking unless it is something that we decide is just not suitable for the project and\u2026\nNeil Smith: Just second.\nMatt Heon: should be entirely removed.\nMiloslav Trmac: Yes, our priorities and ideas of the project can change over\nGiuseppe Scrivano: Yeah, I mean sometimes it happens that I Google for some errors and from libraries or other open source projects and they end up on a GitHub issue. If I see it open, I find it's useful to know that no one looked at it and the first impression. Then if you find it closed, it's either people don't care or they fixed closing issues just by their range. I don't see the advantage not for the users I mean when we are forced to the bug week we go back to this old issue and see if something changed what we know now but otherwise I just look at what's coming new we have enough stuff new coming to see if to reage it and understand if it's to fix now or\u2026\nNeil Smith: Okay.\nGiuseppe Scrivano: just\nGiuseppe Scrivano: document that it exist. yeah.\nTom Sweeney: I don't know if this would work or not, but if we went into one of our projects and then put on a whole bunch of tags on older issues with closing, considering closing some label along those lines. If we don't get a response after 60 days that this is important to me, then go ahead and closing it. kind of give them a shot over the bow that we're going to think about closing this one.\nTom Sweeney: If it's important to remove this label or make a comment here. What\nGiuseppe Scrivano: Yeah, I mean that's like I need for info on back there is something like that classifying such issues that we are blocked\u2026\nGiuseppe Scrivano: because we don't know and then the user disappears then that makes sense to close and to give some time to it put a label and\u2026\nGiuseppe Scrivano: nothing happens. Let's close it in 30 days or something.\nNeil Smith: I like please look at the graph.\nNeil Smith: The slope is basically we're adding 500 open bugs per year right now on top of everything.  So, at some point in time, and this might get even bigger as we go along, if we're never doing anything about them, this will be a ginormous number. and I don't do this. you guys are doing this. So, you have to think of how you want to manage this. so,\nPaul Holzinger: Speaking from experience, there is quite a lot of hate against the stalebot from users because most projects are using the stalebot to close issues and you have a lot of comments if the stalebot kicks in. Please don't close this issue because it just creates this negative attitude cuz I think you just don't want things to be closed at least not when there are bug reports and nobody has looked at things especially then it's just not fair to the user. and I don't know if things keep growing\u2026\n00:30:00\nNeil Smith: Yep.\nPaul Holzinger: then we need to spend more time on issues and less working on features if that's the thing right and that goes pretty much the same for every bug source that is\nMiloslav Trmac: This is the community cabal. It would be nice to have from hear from somebody not from historically we've had looked at this and we've had crafts of whe whether the part that is growing is features or bugs and that differs quite a lot between the projects.\nMiloslav Trmac: Although a lot of it is also that it frequently isn't charged enough to even be categorized.\nTom Sweeney: any other thoughts, comments, questions Yeah.\nNeil Smith: Yeah, I was really hoping to get a community member's opinion.\nNeil Smith: But we will keep thinking about this.\nTom Sweeney: James is adding that he would prefer to keep them open. Zack.\nNeil Smith: Maybe we somehow mark the ones we've opened that we've looked at them with a triage flag or\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Good. Yeah.\nNeil Smith: something so that you never have to go back there and then just back with people's to-do lists of looking at things. Okay, Zach, you ready?\nZack Zlotnik: Yeah, I'm ready but it looks like Jonathan's busy just because I don't want to misattribute some of his thoughts because after this him and I have had some discussions about that. if it would be more helpful, I can certainly come up with a more cohesive way to describe my idea and\u2026\nZack Zlotnik: and present it again in the future if that might be more helpful. Okay, I can do that. Thanks.\nTom Sweeney: Love to have you anytime for that or\u2026\nTom Sweeney: anything else. Yeah. just as for informational we have this a meeting every first Tuesday of the month. one month, this one is more of a design kind of meeting and the the even number of months are for more doing demos and such showing things that are going. So whichever you think we best all right given that and\u2026\nZack Zlotnik: Good to know. Thank you.\nTom Sweeney: we've gone through our topics for the day. So are there any questions or open discussions that people want to have?\nTom Sweeney: While folks are thinking about that, our next cabal meeting is Tuesday, May 6th. And our next cabal meeting, oops, am I getting the dates wrong here? March. No, that's the Cabal meeting is on May 6. And then we have a community meeting and it's wrong in the agenda. I'll have to change that. Will be on April Fool's Day. No fooling. Yes, we ought to do a theme of some sort.\nNeil Smith: It'll be a fun meeting.\nTom Sweeney: I can't imagine what kind of theme you could do though. Any other questions, comments, discussions? If not, we'll stop the recording and thank everybody for coming and for doing the presentations today.\nZack Zlotnik: Thanks folks.\nTom Sweeney: Okay, recording's off. Last chance to say things without being recorded. Otherwise, I'm going to suggest you go to lunch, dinner, or what have you.\nGerry Seidman: One side note, Tom, is and I think somebody commented about it is the links to the recording are kind of circular links because I actually wanted to look at something that was said in last week's last the February 4th meeting of the community and\u2026\nGerry Seidman: it just went in circles.\nTom Sweeney: Really? Yeah.\nGerry Seidman: So, you might want to check those. Yeah. Yeah.\nTom Sweeney: For the February 4th meeting. I will check that and I will get back with you, Jerry, if I'm finding problems with them or can't find problems.\n00:35:00\nGerry Seidman: I don't need to now. I mean, I ended up just doing the research without looking at I just wanted to I was trying to remember something that Dan said and\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Okay.\nGerry Seidman: I couldn't cool. You got it.\nTom Sweeney: Yeah. Thank you for the heads up. I appreciate that.\nTom Sweeney: Right folks, I think that's it.\nTom Sweeney: I'm going to capture some\nBrent Baude: Jerry, can you stick behind?\nGerry Seidman: I'm sorry.\nBrent Baude: Could you stay behind?\nGerry Seidman: Did I stay behind? Am I here? In other words,\u2026\nBrent Baude: After everyone leaves, could you stay?\nGerry Seidman: Could I stay? Yes, I can. Yes, I can.\nBrent Baude: Yeah. I was just going to follow up on your email, so I thought\u2026\nGerry Seidman: Right.\nBrent Baude: why not? Okay.\nGerry Seidman: Yeah, Absolutely. I didn't even see that you gave a reply.\nBrent Baude: All did you get a chance to read my reply?\nGerry Seidman: So, the answer is no.\nBrent Baude: \u2026\nGerry Seidman: I take a quick look at it if you'd like.\nBrent Baude: it's just take a quick look. and I can follow up with it at all. it just gives us a chance to talk about it. Unless you have somewhere to be.\nGerry Seidman: I not have time now. You want to talk now? let me just give it a quick look. You\nGerry Seidman: Okay.\nGerry Seidman: That's more like the use case that I was thinking of. but when Dan was there he talked about two cow images single files.\nBrent Baude: So that Yeah.\nBrent Baude: Let me tell you about that. There's really kind of like two when Dan talks about that. I think there's two scenarios. One is already something that happens in Podman that most people don't know about which is when you use Pod. Are you familiar with Podman machine?\nGerry Seidman: No, not really.\nBrent Baude: So if you're on a Mac and you want to run Podman, you basically have to carve out a VM and have Podman run inside of that. We can do that.\nBrent Baude: We can do that sort of all automatically with podman machine which is a verb in podman that allows you to on Windows, Mac and Linux. It carves out a VM and lets you do it that way. Then kind of does a remote connection with SSH between the VM and the host machine. And that is a custom OS and we pull our QCows or\u2026\nGerry Seidman: Okay.\nBrent Baude: our HDXs from an OCI registry as OCI artifacts.\nBrent Baude: fairly kind of custom approach, but it's a good example of how artifacts can be used and distributed. that's one area that he talks about that and how it gets used.  The other there has been a pretty big push from people that they are basically looking for new distribution methods for binary blobs in OCI registry seems they think it's a good way to do it.\nGerry Seidman: Fire. Okay.\nBrent Baude: I think that's out for debate, but one thing is that there are some advantages. So there are people putting actually u cows out there as OCI artifacts and then using things like Orus to pull it down.\nBrent Baude: Theoretically you could do that now with Podman. You would pull it down and then go from there. I think one of the big debates on these artifacts are the format. So whether or not it's a binary blob that's been shoved in an OCI image. And there's sort of two camps on that at this point. Yep.\nGerry Seidman: Mhm.\nGerry Seidman: But whenever I talk with the orus people, they're talking about a compressed directory of files.\nGerry Seidman: That's really the use case that I'm coming in from. correct.\nBrent Baude: Yeah. a tarball of a directory that's\u2026\n00:40:00\nBrent Baude: then been compressed?\nGerry Seidman: \nGerry Seidman: Yeah. because they\u2026\nBrent Baude: And what we're Yeah.\nGerry Seidman: if they want to load store a model in an OCI registry the model isn't a single file it's a tree of\nBrent Baude: And what we're saying is I guess that the approach we're taking is that we would prefer the way Podman's thinking about it is we don't really have an opinion on format but we do have some opinion that artifacts are binary blobs that are affiliated with the manifest and that's as a layer and that's about it.\nGerry Seidman: Yeah. Yeah.\nBrent Baude: And there probably is from\u2026\nGerry Seidman: I'm just letting you know there's a disconnect then because that's not the use case. When I was at CubeCon,\u2026\nBrent Baude: where you sit.\nGerry Seidman: nobody talked about that.\nBrent Baude: Yeah From where I sit there is no disconnect but because I don't really think that orus is following an OCI standard which we're more or less required to do. I mean, they're not breaking any rules, but per se, but \u2026\nBrent Baude: they're adding function on top of it. That is to say, I could do what Orus does with Podman and a bash script in a container image, if that makes sense, and a volume. you can just pardon. Yeah.\nGerry Seidman: and just expand it local.\nGerry Seidman: Expand it locally and then just expand it locally and then mount the local file.\nBrent Baude: I mean that's the point of the PR that I pointed to you is when you pull an artifact it comes down as a blob now in podman in a managed directory and\u2026\nGerry Seidman: Mhm.\nBrent Baude: then you say hey and it has a name associated with it and you say hey I want to mount that into container you're going to be able to do -v followed by the artifact name and then where you want it mounted and\u2026\nGerry Seidman: Mhm. Yeah.\nBrent Baude: then when you run the container that you have to know what's in that in order to deal with it because\nGerry Seidman: Of course, that's going to always be the case with artifact. But are you saying that there's one directory for all of them? because the image name, the Or image path is that when you're mounting something, you're mounting a directory. You're not mounting a file. So, how do you reconcile the file name with\u2026\nBrent Baude: Because the annotation has to have a title. Yep.\nGerry Seidman: what you're doing? Okay. I totally hear you and again I have a bias of course but coming from CubeCon where everything was about AI and models and training sets that the conversation around this was a desire to store them\nGerry Seidman: and container registries along with provenence and along with annotations for things like provenence and\u2026\nGerry Seidman: things like that the things you want for AI so they see that's their motivation for why it should be in a containeration got it so there already had been something called model side cars or\u2026\nBrent Baude: Yeah. Yes.\nGerry Seidman: something like that which emulated what you're talking about with the bash. and\u2026\nBrent Baude: Yeah. Yep.\nGerry Seidman: then that led to image volume. so I'm just giving you the context from the conversations I had.\nBrent Baude: It's a wild west.\nGerry Seidman: So you have two different people viewing. Go ahead. Sorry. Mhm.\nBrent Baude: I should say whenever my management comes and what's up with these artifacts, I just tell them it's a wild west s*** show.\nBrent Baude: I literally say that because artifacts are meant to be loosely bound and non-specific and now we're trying to make it specific ound. So you can't really have both. if we really wanted to do this right and we ever thought that the OCI folks would ever actually write a standard we'd do that and\u2026\nGerry Seidman: Mhm. Yeah.\nBrent Baude: write us a definitive way to do all this but part of what makes artifacts powerful is there are no rules Yep.\nGerry Seidman: I mean I'll tell you in some sense one of the nice things about artifacts is they can have annotations like anything on the container registry can have annotations so you could do semantic stuff\u2026\n00:45:00\nGerry Seidman: but by the same argument take a file name is a file name if it happens to have a tar file format and I send it to tar thing good things happen and if it happens to be a text file and I send it to tar bad things happen so People do things in context.\nBrent Baude: Yep. Yeah.\nGerry Seidman: And the nice thing about annotations is annotations in some sorts are analogous to file attributes.\nBrent Baude: So, one thing we are contemplating you what you see in that PRJ it's our first just putting our toe in the water about how we think this is going to be used or\u2026\nBrent Baude: how it would be useful.\nBrent Baude: we know for a fact it is the next step however is we essentially plan to expose making an artifact directly into a volume and said volume could have a driver that knows how to deal with that file. and then we would allow that, basically a custom volume plug-in driver to do whatever needs to be done with the artifact for container storage.\nGerry Seidman: \u2026\nGerry Seidman: my bias is that underneath that is the same storage library that you use for container layers. And if you Yep.\nGerry Seidman: Yep. Because way this thing that I care about\u2026\nBrent Baude: Yeah, that is the case.\nGerry Seidman: which is additional layer storage will work for free.\nBrent Baude: Yeah, I mean we're not there yet because we sort of couldn't convince the container storage folks that artifact should be part of its domain. So we do\u2026\nGerry Seidman: Okay.\nBrent Baude: what we actually did with volume drivers and that we follow the basic principles. It's in the same directory. It's just not part of the same library. So, there aren't locks for it that, we would like to see, but we are headed that way. That is a goal of mine.\nGerry Seidman: Just so I'm not trying to give you grief. I'm just trying to share conversations that I've had.\nBrent Baude: No.\nBrent Baude: If I didn't want to know things, then I wouldn't have bothered. I just left it with the email. but really\nGerry Seidman: Yeah, I can't tell you\u2026\nGerry Seidman: how many times I have clients that say, \"We want it.\" And they gave me no requirements and restrictions of what they want. Mhm. Right.\nGerry Seidman: \nBrent Baude: Yep. Yeah.\nBrent Baude: And there is no emerging standard. This has been the problem with it. There's just no emerging standard way to I mean we got to write it programmatically. So there has to be some rules and we just haven't really nailed down other than some basic OCI standards we got to follow with. But how it's going to be used and how it should be implemented is, we're just not dead And AI comes up as the predominant use case right now,\u2026\nGerry Seidman: Mhm. Yeah.\nBrent Baude: but their solution seems to be ignore what everyone else does and for every model go write a special whatever for it. And I can't stop that.\nGerry Seidman: And I hear I mean there's so many groups in the AI space in Kubernetes and\u2026\nGerry Seidman: the AI space that are developing s** the inference engines folk and the K server folks and the whatever \u2026\nBrent Baude: There must be a dozen and\u2026\nBrent Baude: a half projects in Red Hat essentially doing what's already been done for months by us, but now we're going to write it in Python and now we're going to write it in Rust. So, it's just one of these or no, we want to be able to process the file, outbound, do something with it. And, yeah, it's the which beast do you satisfy? I don't know.\nGerry Seidman: so let me give you share some explicit client stuff, being that, we're under NDA with Red Hat and you're Red Hat. not that I'm saying anything Goldman is the customer that's driving a lot of the stuff we're doing in containers and\u2026\nBrent Baude: Mhm.\nGerry Seidman: \nGerry Seidman: open shift. and this whole, container accelerator thing I did came from requirements from Golden because they thought distributing container images was very inefficient and they have whole systems that actually use technology to deploy software. every application in Goldman is deployed using our software. Forget about containers.  And they get a lot of benefit from that because if you're distributing to 200,000 machines, you don't really want to send the full application every time to every node if it's not going to use it. So that's historically what they built around our technology. And they then came to us and said, \"Look, we don't like the container how containers work. Can you do the same thing in containers?\"\n00:50:00\nGerry Seidman: And that's where the ALS stuff led to the thing that we wrote. Full stop.\nBrent Baude: Mhm.\nGerry Seidman: Their initial group is using They're not open shift for the ALS stuff. still haven't deployed, but they're getting close. they kick the tires harder each time I give them a version. and the open shift folks are now ramped it up as well.\nGerry Seidman: So now there's that now when I had my last meeting with the open shift team they brought up AI modeling and for open shift you have the image volume and they were very interested for that purpose \u2026\nGerry Seidman: because the image volumes can leverage ALS I haven't heard yet from the podman team but I have a funny feeling that if that it may come from that may bubble Okay.\nBrent Baude: What exactly?\nBrent Baude: Cuz you are talking to the P team.\nGerry Seidman: So no, no, I'm just telling you. absolutely. No. basically in open shift they're going to want to le they have the idea that they will leverage additional layer storage for loading things like models\u2026\nBrent Baude: Okay. Yeah.\nGerry Seidman: which they haven't yet thought about that in the team that's using straight pod but I have a funny feeling that that's not far. I may be totally wrong because I don't know what they're doing and they haven't actually deployed anything yet,\u2026\nGerry Seidman: but they're thinking about how to, because they're at a scale that nobody runs at, they're running 200,000 machines,\u2026\nBrent Baude: or what as far as podman's concerned are they wanting to do additional I mean you're basically talking about artifacts in additional storage right?\nGerry Seidman: Yeah. right now nobody has asked about it with five men yet.\nBrent Baude: Yeah. But what do you think they're\u2026\nGerry Seidman: Full stop.\nBrent Baude: where do you think Are they headed to wanting a single store for an entire system of root unprivileged users sharing the same models\u2026\nGerry Seidman: They would be unprivileged. in terms of why do you bring up unprivileged users? the answer is yes.\nBrent Baude: because we get\nGerry Seidman: They run everything in root list but the container registry the content has someles as well.\nBrent Baude: Yeah, I mean the reason I bring it up is because additional stores of late has been a feature that's been asked about and wanted more function from across the board. we're just seeing a lot more of it and\u2026\nGerry Seidman: Great.\nBrent Baude: the use cases have sort of expanded beyond what we had contemplated when implementing that. So the one that seems to be emerging is just that there's a server or system out there and they want it's actually because they think it's more secure.\nBrent Baude: They want to have a store where you can only run images from that is generally the way they're headed.\nGerry Seidman: Right. Yeah. Yeah. you need with the FS Verity stuff.\nBrent Baude: I think no what they're wanting us they're wanting Podman to get involved in enforcement of their corporate policies especially in the financial services sector. So they want us to be able to implement ways to restrict users from running whatever they want.\nGerry Seidman: Yeah, the interesting thing is in podman I could actually do that with ALS on a subcontainer layer because it's sitting on top of our distributed file. because when they run a container they're running as two users. They're running as the Linux user and\u2026\n00:55:00\nGerry Seidman: they're running as the forest store user. and ALS gives,\u2026\nBrent Baude: Mhm. You have a problem.\nGerry Seidman: excuse me.\nBrent Baude: Yeah. Yeah.\nGerry Seidman: Yeah, we have a very very robust security policy. People like our security policy. One of the nice things about our security policy we put to the DoD actually was we have a concept of combined identity that I'm just shar.\nGerry Seidman: The machine is keyed as well. So, \u2026\nBrent Baude: We are highly resistant.\nBrent Baude: We are highly resistant going anywhere near enforcement of policy.\nGerry Seidman: I'm just sharing that I agree.\nBrent Baude: Yeah. Yeah.\nBrent Baude: No, no. I'm just saying that I think it's important for you to know because if you're talking to these folks, I mean, you can and you talk to the architects of Podman and he's not going to write you a cuz I'm telling you,\u2026\nBrent Baude: you name the financial services company, they've come and asked for it.\nGerry Seidman: Absolutely.\nGerry Seidman: I'm not asking for anything. I'm just sharing.\nBrent Baude: No,\u2026\nGerry Seidman: And the motivation for that combined identity it was a precursor for them to start doing first mode into the cloud\u2026\nBrent Baude: I know you are.\nGerry Seidman: because they wanted to make sure that only certain machines in the cloud without having to set up VPNs and all that. I've shared information. s nothing's happened today. I just didn't want there to be a collision course.\nGerry Seidman: I wanted you to be aware of that there may be a collision course. I have skin in the game, but I they haven't even deployed our standard ALS use case yet. So, who knows if and when they'll do the image volume stuff.\nBrent Baude: Okay.\nBrent Baude: Okay.\nBrent Baude: Back to the point of your email. Was there enough clarification in there? Do you know what we were talking about now?\nGerry Seidman: Yeah.\nGerry Seidman: Yeah. the and\u2026\nBrent Baude: Good. Yeah.\nGerry Seidman: so if I have just as I read it so yes podman-v so what happens you did you do podman-v and something like docker colon blah blah blah blah blah Yeah.\nBrent Baude: You're going to name the artifact in question and then you're going to give it a destination in the container to mount.\nBrent Baude: So to follow the same host h posts inside like you say colon approach that we have today.\nGerry Seidman: Yeah. I mean there's two colon so you have a Yeah.\nBrent Baude: It'll always be read only.\nGerry Seidman: \nGerry Seidman: Yeah. Of course it has to be. and I assume so you in the -v you give a directory and the annotation you give a file name\nBrent Baude: No. the way that PR works is there's a couple pieces of intelligence going on here I guess you call it.\nBrent Baude: One is if it's a s single object artifact, we will then you give it the name of the artifact in the volume mount and the directory in which you want it mounted and\u2026\nBrent Baude: we'll put the one file in there based on the name that it has if there is no annotation we we name it with the hash that it's known by.\nGerry Seidman: Mhm. Okay.\nBrent Baude: If there are multiple objects we have a couple of different approaches there but basically the same result which is this stuff ends up in a directory. But the reality is that's what the nuance is.\nGerry Seidman: Yeah. Yep.\nBrent Baude: been talking about it so long I forgotten half of it. these are basically file mounts into the container. So if it's just a straight file mount.\nBrent Baude: If it's into the directory provided if it is multiples then you get multiple file mounts into the same directory. Yep. Yep.\nGerry Seidman: Yeah. Yeah.\nGerry Seidman: Makes sense. it's the reality between you and me is we don't want people storing their stuff in the container registry because if they store in our distributed file system, they get exactly the same benefit and our security model and they could attributes in our volume to do the Providence stuff. But of course, that's a vendor solution. So, it's a hard stuff.\n01:00:00\nBrent Baude: Right. Right.\nGerry Seidman: Of course, if Redhead buys or store, then we can take everything else first. Never mind.\nBrent Baude: I don't know anything about that.\nGerry Seidman: I'm joking.\nBrent Baude: Sounds good.\nGerry Seidman: All right, Thank you so much for the clarity. Hopefully my survey was useful. and I'll just watch from a distance. if I if I do get a specific use case that Golden says we want to do this, I'll share that.\nBrent Baude: Yeah, that stuff is helpful.\nGerry Seidman: It's vague,\u2026\nBrent Baude: Yeah, that stuff is helpful.\nGerry Seidman: Yeah. Because they don't know what they want to do. I mean, they still haven't figured out containers really either in general, \u2026\nBrent Baude: That's true. Yep.\nGerry Seidman: just like all the major corporations. Yeah. Yeah. For all the trade press,\u2026\nGerry Seidman: unless you're a startup, if you're established enterprise, you're still like I don't know. All right, Thank you so much for the time.\nBrent Baude: My pleasure.\nBrent Baude: Take care.\nGerry Seidman: All right. sorry. I had my screen on. you had a face and I didn't have a face. So all right,\u2026\nBrent Baude: No worries.\nGerry Seidman: You have a great day.\nBrent Baude: All right. Bye-bye.\nGerry Seidman: Hey, byebye.\nThis editable transcript was computer generated and might contain errors.

Today is April 1st, 2025. Just have a quick overview of what's going on today. So we meet on the first Tuesday of even numbered months. Timing might be moved from time to time for making things easier for India, China, Australia and other folks.  topics are driven from prior meetings or requests to me andor the agenda that we have is up and available online at any time that you want to go ahead and add a topic to it. Discussions are accepted for podman, builder, scopio or any related container projects or even container topics that you'd find interesting. Our meeting notes are listed here on this slide. I will put them in the Google chat in a moment here. And then for today, we just have oops can't change there. Just a couple of topics.\nTom Sweeney: So plenty of opportunity to ask your own questions. So we don't have a podman 54 update unless Matt has something he wants to talk about quickly. That was a cut and paste there. We do plan to talk about the updates to the CNCF governance document that Matt has been working on recently and we'll be going online soon. We're also going to be talking a little bit about upcoming changes to the triage and upstream authority part of which is driven by our move to CNCF.  And then just a quick reminder that our next meeting for the community meeting anyway is June 3rd, 2025. And with all that, I'm going to wrap up and hand it off to Matt.\nMatt Heon: Hi folks. let me drop a link in the chat of the governance model. So the governance model is a pull request against the podman repository right now. We've been working on it for I want to say a month now and I think we're getting very close to where we want to be. there are still some points that we are debating and I think we'll have a public debate on one of those points a bit later.  But I just want to say that I am trying to get this merged by end of this week. And with that, we'll be adopting the governance model as soon as it merges and basically starting to run things according to it. Honestly, we're trying to run as close to We're trying to run things as close we can to it even as of now. But, once it merges, we'll be officially following it. And now I believe we can actually go back to a debate we were having a couple minutes ago off this call.\nMatt Heon: Brent, do we want to talk about whether we should have a role dedicated to triage and\u2026\nMatt Heon: specifically to assist us with triaging issues upstream?\nBrent Baude: Yeah, I think\u2026\nBrent Baude: if you just walk the roles real quick for everyone and then that probably would help seed that conversation and maybe somewhat explain the mismatch in roles and what we have to do.  Yep.\nMatt Heon: Give me a moment to get the text size big enough that people can actually see what I'm talking about. And Let me share my screen. Can everyone see this? And is text size okay?\nTom Sweeney: Yes.\nMatt Heon: So basically as the governance model is written right now we have three roles for contributors of authority. the first one of those is Reviewers are intended to be code reviewers who do not have merge authority. They are primarily going to be looking at pull requests identifying things that can be basically doing pull request review.  They are also involved in issue triage and they have the authority to review pull requests but not to merge them. Then we go up to Maintainers are people with merge authority but only on a single repository. the podman project as you may know was donated in three separate pieces. Podman, build and scopio. And because of that we don't have a role that has right authority on all three of them initially.\nMatt Heon: We have the maintainer role where you have right authority but only on a single repo. Basically, you're familiar enough with one of the projects to be a maintainer, but you are not someone who's familiar with everything. And then finally, we step up to Core maintainers are people who have enough experience with the project to make decisions for the whole project. So, you get right authority on all repositories. You get a vote at meetings where we decide the fate of the whole project. things of that nature. And what we don't have is something underneath reviewer. So we have a role that is eligible to review pull requests,\u2026\nBrent Baude: Can you scroll down so we can see the reviewer privileges?\nMatt Heon: but we don't have a role that has more limited privileges. I can just go ahead and look at issues and decide this issue needs more information. I'm going to apply labels it to that effect. This issue has been triaged.\n00:05:00\nMatt Heon: I'm going to apply labels saying that it's high priority things to that effect. So these are the responsibilities, requirements and privileges of reviewers. reviewers have very limited privileges in the sense that they have the ability to approve poll requests and\u2026\nMatt Heon: they have the approve ability to recommend other reviewers. But that is it.\nBrent Baude: At first blush,\u2026\nBrent Baude: this seems to be pretty good in terms of at least what I had for the idea of a triager. do folks see any issues with any conflict between reviewer and triager? can they be the same thing?\nMatt Heon: I think it's already written into the responsibilities that they will assist in issue triage. So if we want to have them be the same thing, that is perfectly acceptable. I can just add to the privileges that they have right authority but only on labels. I think GitHub calls it triage authority.  That will allow them to go in and basically mark issues up the way that we need to work on\nBrent Baude: Yeah, I mean that seems reasonable. So the one thing we talked about was this does not include rerun ability because that requires write authority on the repo. Correct.\nMatt Heon: I would hope that we could get reviewers the ability to rerun tests because while they won't have merge authority, they should have enough to approve poll requests.\nBrent Baude: Paul, is that even I mean we rerunning the test keys off right authority? No.\nMatt Heon: I'm hoping that'll be enough. If it's not, then that would be tragic because it's very hard to review pull requests without the ability to rerun the tests.\nPaul Holzinger: That's my understanding. But I also think if you log in the sirus web UI with your account, you should be able to rerun your own tests even if you don't have right on the repo.\nBrent Baude: It's okay.\nPaul Holzinger: But I'm not sure since my account obviously has all the rights. So not quite sure how this interface looks if you don't have any permissions whatsoever in zeros at least on GitHub. I know it will not present you with the option to rerun if you don't have right access. in general if the concern is rerunning tests and I mean the pain isn't just a viewer a new person the pain is for every maintainer all the time clicking rerun.\nPaul Holzinger: if we want to have a better automated way to do that then that's something that can be worked on. that if you have some higher privilege spot kicking off the rerunning the tasks for you that could work for anybody I guess.\nBrent Baude: others. Tim, you're from the Podman desktop folks. do you have any thoughts to contribute?\nTim deBoer: You're catching me out. I was starting to look at something else.\nBrent Baude: Matt, I mean, I guess the question is what I think this whole thing just revolves around right authority and what that really means. Agree.\nMatt Heon: I don't think the reviewer role should have right authority as written. It's not someone who should be merging things. So, I'm okay with it as written. I'll just expand it to say that they will have triage privileges in GitHub so they can modify labels. But I would really like it\u2026\nBrent Baude: Right.\nMatt Heon: if we could get the ability to rerun tests in here. And I know that that's what I'm saying. We've just decided is impossible. But it really sucks that it is\nTim deBoer: Sorry, I don't know if this helps, but I know we have a case where when we have something in draft state on GitHub, it only runs a subset of the tests, but if you add a label, it'll run more tests. so that might be a way of giving somebody\u2026\n00:10:00\nTim deBoer: who has reviewer who can't commit to the repo, but hey, they can add a label and that'll change which tests run.\nBrent Baude: Yeah, the specific problem we're trying to solve or\u2026\nBrent Baude: understand or talk about here, Tom, Tim, is that we have tests that will periodically fail or flake, but our merge bot will not allow a merge to occur if tests fail. So you have to have the ability to go in and click rerun, to get it to rerun and pass. And that requires GitHub right authority as far as we know today. So we have a mismatch in\u2026\nBrent Baude: in terms of what we'd like for privileges versus responsibilities.\nTim deBoer: Yeah, that's an odd unfortunate one on GitHub.\nBrent Baude: What Paul is saying I think it perhaps is more related to how the Cirrus plugin to GitHub works or something. So, we've got some exploration to do.\nTim deBoer: Yeah, but again, maybe there's a label where you can have a bot that looks at a label and when it's added or removed or something, it has the authority to go rerun the test. I don't know. There's more work.\nBrent Baude: Not a terrible idea.\nPaul Holzinger: I mean the basic issue is sort of we have different CI systems which makes this really difficult. We have mainly zeros which offers you to rerun either via GitHub UI where there's a rerun button for each failed test or you go into the seros web UI if you actually go into the details and then you have another rerun button there. I'm not sure if both of them need the same privileges or not. that needs to be tested. But the real problem is if you go further than zeros, there is packet which has some packet specific commands to rerun. I have no idea what permissions those need. And GitHub actions is used as well. Not really much on Potman, but they are uses and\u2026\nBrent Baude: Yeah.\nPaul Holzinger: those will only ever be rerun via GitHub obviously.\nPaul Holzinger: So that's sort of the issue and I guess in the day-to-day work only we care about the zeros but the other stuff must be considered too.\nMatt Heon: Ashley.\nAshley Cui: I know our open shiftbot has a slash rerun command. Does that do anything or\u2026\nAshley Cui: or will that trigger any of our tests or do we currently have it to ignore things? Okay. Okay,\u2026\nBrent Baude: My understanding is the rerun command will rerun tests that you have written in open shift\u2026\nBrent Baude: which we don't use open shift as a test platform. We just use the bot as a merge protection.\nAshley Cui: because I think I might be wrong, but packet has a slashpacket retest function. So I was wondering if we had a command that we could configure users to be able to retest things. But if that's not how it works, then we can look into other options.\nPaul Holzinger: Yeah, the open shift commands are all set up with their own open shift vi sort of thing.\nAshley Cui: Okay.\nPaul Holzinger: That's another issue with us using part of open shift bots.  It's very confusing what's implemented and what's not. in open shift the way it works you have the okay to test and then people can run retest as far as the packet one as I said that that exists and works. I'm not sure if it works for everybody or only checks the permissions of the user who wrote the command. that I'm not sure.  Yeah.\nAshley Cui: I guess the other thing is maybe we can look into if there's a way to retrigger off tests based on comments. so that we could set custom permissions.  But that's probably a whole other can of worms,\nPaul Holzinger: But I mean the problem is always you need to consider abuse and people can trigger I don't know thousands of jobs if things go wrong. it's also not that great. I mean right now they can create as many PRs as they want or force push as often as they want.  I guess that's already a possibility for them to go rogue, I guess.\n00:15:00\nBrent Baude: Matt, maybe there's a card here to at least educate oursel on what permissions are required to do what and\u2026\nMatt Heon: Yeah, I think that's reasonable.\nBrent Baude: spike that out and then we have information to actually operate from. yeah.\nMatt Heon: All right, sounds good. All right, Tom is apparently having to drop because his laptop is having issues. So, I will ask, is there anything more we should do on this because I know there was another topic you had, Brent? I think that's reasonable.\nBrent Baude: I was just going to say so just if let's transition to the other part.  Yeah, there's nothing specific here, but I do think we as a team have never sat down and sort of come up with a final or a collective decision on when dealing with issues and PRs that either languish\nBrent Baude: or are inaccurate won't do those kinds of things. And as we're trying to have an effort, if the team doesn't the outsiders haven't recognized, we're trying to kind of build up a little bit more of a process so that we do what we say we're supposed to be doing and that's about it kind of an approach.  So, I think there's a couple of topics in there, Matt. Maybe you can kind of help us guide through some of it, but one is, what are the requirements for issues? I think we're generally in agreement that we don't want to go through and just start closing all out issues cuz they're old because we do see some value in that.\nBrent Baude: And it's been pointed out if somebody did want to come and fix something and contribute it, we don't really want to hide that stuff either. Generally, is that the case how the team feels?\nPaul Holzinger: That's how I feel. Let's check.\nBrent Baude: Yeah. Others Yeah.\nMatt Heon: I'm okay with it. I'm not completely satisfied with the answer, but yeah, I don't have a better solution.\nBrent Baude: I think if we kind of generally agree that we can find something that works for those that get stressed out by the sheer number. but yet we don't close the door on things that may be valid or somebody wants to contribute to.  I guess one of the things I've been kind of kicking around is what is the criteria for actually closing an issue that's not going to get done?  And one of the ideas I was kicking around actually with Lewis the other day is I'm kind of thinking there's the certainly staleness is a factor but it can't be the single reason why you would close off an issue.\nBrent Baude: But I'm thinking that it's a combination of stale not enough information they didn't provide the minimum information and no reproducer and pro possibly something else. does that put a level of comfortability for folks though if we were to come up with criteria like that that was sort of multi-headed beast that we would begin to close some things\nTim deBoer: And my feedback I think there's some things that are just clearly bad ideas architecturally wrong whatever. and I think you respond to those and say no it's not going to get done. but the things where you say, \"Hey, I need more info.\" And then you don't get a response or, \"Yeah, it's not a bad idea, but we're working on other things and, it never seems to get done.\" it's just easier if you use a stale bot. basically the one that we use in Potman Desktop, it puts a comment in, you decide how many, days. If there's no activity, it puts a comment in, says, \"Hey, if you care, put a comment.\n00:20:00\nTim deBoer: if you don't it's going to disappear in another 30 days and again you configure it and then it just closes it out and I think that nonhuman it's not somebody saying no we'll never do this it's just a bot is a little bit friendlier for whatever reason and\u2026\nTim deBoer: you don't have to worry about those two cents\nBrent Baude: comments from folks.\nBrent Baude: I have one but to hear from others. I think we have a stalebot, but that's the part we're just not quite comfortable with.  It may very well be valid, but just because it could be a valid bug, but not high enough priority or not something we're able to nail down because we don't have the hardware or the environment. And maybe somebody comes by and does and is willing to fix it. that's our hesitation on having a stalebot be the sole deciding factor.\nTim deBoer: Yeah, but I mean people have that period where all they need to do is drop a comment I still care about this and it stays open or you just live with the fact that if it was important somebody else is going to open another one or\u2026\nTim deBoer: somebody will reopen it two months from now.\nBrent Baude: A lot of me talking and\u2026\nBrent Baude: that means that I'm going to get my way if you all don't speak up.\nPaul Holzinger: I think there are two things.  So first of all we are pretty much already closing everything that's like we don't want to do this or it's invalid or not possible or whatever I think we are trying to move towards more of this gray area right towards and some things we know we won't work on but we didn't close them because technically they are a bug or an issue\nPaul Holzinger: but they aren't important or it's I don't know whatever distribution you never heard of something or where you cannot confidently tell it's not a Portman thing but your gut tells you it's not a Portman thing or something like that and this is sort of the issue since it's\nPaul Holzinger: it's a very personal decision to if you think it's actually not something we do or not because as individual it's difficult to make the decision we will never do that maybe the colleague thinks it's a great idea and stuff like that I don't know or it's a real issue this is sort of in my eyes what the policy needs to address in  Some sense where we have some line of definitions. What counts as we keep and what counts as we close.\nMohan Boddu: I totally understand the difference between stale and the things that we cannot do right and Brent was we can close them if they are stale but Brent was talking about they are valid but it's not part of the priorities or it's not in the direction that we want.  Maybe how about adding a label to them help and if someone from the community wants to pick it up, they can easily go and look at these are the tickets that the podband maintainers need help from and they can go and do the help and stalebot will still continue and if they don't respond it get closed.\nMohan Boddu: But if do they respond the help label thing will keep it open you as maintainers don't have to take care of it but someone from the community can take a look at them.\n00:25:00\nJan Kaluza: Yeah, if I can I agree with what Moan said and what Paul said. I think it the tailbox there are two parts of the one is that it's some sign for us that we will not be working on that maybe because we don't have it in priority list and so on but we have to also clearly communicate it to the users that this is not something we count with right now if nothing changes so I wouldn't close those bugs  I would keep them open but also keep the communication clear and honest that right now if nothing changes we don't treat it as a priority and we will keep this open for someone else to take it or if something changes in our resources or priorities we might get back to it.\nJan Kaluza: I'm not sure if the issue is that we have too many issues open and is hard for us to orient in that case I would just label them and relate those which we do not care about let's filter them out but still leave them open because they are still valid of course if the issue is not valid at all and we would never accept the PR no matter what on this subject I will just close it with explanation  So I mean that's also what I did in my previous projects I was working on.\nBrent Baude: One thing I'm wondering is I'm maybe trying to take too big of a bite here and we look at this mass and that's what's giving us hesitation is this is just too big of a thing what? I'm wondering if going after this more tactically in the sense that we go after specific ones and agree upon those it cuts down x% of what we got.\nBrent Baude: So an example would be I think for me one of the more frustrating aspects of the issue reporting that is an incomplete issue meaning they didn't give us enough information to understand what's going on. There's no reproducer or the reproducer is really crazy and not something you can really expect to do. anything that's just missing to me, I'd like to see those get handled out of this entire conversation.\nBrent Baude: Those would be the ones I would like to get off and closed because I'm not sure an issue that's incomplete is of any help to anyone long term.\nJan Kaluza: Yeah, I think I was first. So I will start. So I think if you close the issue then if someone else hits the same issue and finds it using Google half year from now it can be opened right so I mean if it makes it easier for us to maintain the backlog if we close such issues with some explanation to the user that they are free to open it once the information is provided I think that's good way to go.\nMatt Heon: We close and lock legacy issues basically we have an epidemic of people commenting on really old issues and saying I have this too even though it's been fixed.  So we really want people to file a new bug in that case and give us proper information.\nBrent Baude: Yeah. or\u2026\nBrent Baude: it's an extremely generic error message and it can be 15 different things that falls under it that's not productive either. I guess I'm going to cue Ashley here, but the one thing I would say is this would not be out of the gate. What I'm proposing would not be I reported an issue and I'm shutting you down. You didn't give me everything you want. It would have to be in combination with a lack of response.  I think we all agree we give them plenty of opportunity to fill in the blanks. Ashley\n00:30:00\nAshley Cui: I agree with that. I think this is the use case of putting a label on saying needs more info and then if after x amount of days there's no new comments or no updates of the issue updates of information. this is where I would want things to be automatically closed. I don't agree with closing stale issues that have been along around for too long, but issues that are missing information and the reporter hasn't responded, that's where I would be 100% okay with closing it after a few days. so something like putting a label on it saying needs more info.\nAshley Cui: and then if a comment appears we can automatically remove the label and if no comment appears or there's no updates after that time we could automatically close any issues with the label of needs more information after x amount of days.\nBrent Baude: Do we have across the board? And please object if you don't like this idea. Is that something we can agree on?\nTom Sweeney: Yeah. Although I would think we should bump it out more than a few days just to couple weeks.\nBrent Baude: Yes, of course. So I let's circle back to what that should be. But if someone doesn't like this idea at all, then it's moot to argue about.\nTom Sweeney: I like saying few days.  base and that part.\nBrent Baude: So in general other than dictating what the time is, I just sort of say is that a good compromise for how we would manage our issues?\nPaul Holzinger: I think that's\u2026\nPaul Holzinger: how it's already done, just not automated. And that's where I think it's the good thing to have it more automated. Uh-huh. That's\nBrent Baude: I have two motivations for talking about this,\u2026\nBrent Baude: Paul. one is I think you and I are kind of more prone to doing that. So, I would like it to be applied across the board by everyone. And the second piece is if someone is unhappy with what we did, I would like to be able to point to where we documented this is how we're going to do it.\nBrent Baude: So that's the other piece here why I'm trying to get everyone on agree agreeing on this. I think that Podman's a good testing ground\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Yeah. Are you talking about doing this just for Podman or\u2026\nTom Sweeney: rolling it in Podman and expanding later or going all at once? Podman build the scope deal.\nBrent Baude: because we get a lot of everything and if it doesn't work then it's not going to work in other places probably would be my guess.\nBrent Baude: So, I would say trial document and trial it in Podman. If we agree and if there aren't, complaints, then it seems like something that we could just pass in real quickly to others.\nPaul Holzinger: Isn't the documentation already in what's like issue MD or how did they call this?\nBrent Baude: It doesn't precisely call this out it says we may have closed your thing for this that or that but it doesn't say this is how we're doing it explicitly. So I would like to tighten that up. I was thinking either 30 or 45 days on the time.\nTom Sweeney: I think 30 is sufficient to give somebody time to get back in and say yes this is important or what have you.\nBrent Baude: The real downside to this I'll just sort of say I'll spill the beans here. The one downside to this approach with a label needs more info is it I mean I think the upside is clear.\nBrent Baude: The downside is users can't take labels off. So if a user fills in what we needed, they can't remove the label. somebody is going to have to do that from the team. we're going to have to assume that if someone comments that was enough to remove the label and have it automatically done. But that's the one thing I see that's kind of problematic here.\nPaul Holzinger: Yeah, that's what I think with automation. you need to remove the label as soon as there's a comment from the user and\u2026\nPaul Holzinger: then if it's not enough, you need to apply it again because I mean if they comment, you technically need to read it again no matter what. you didn't know what the reply was. You need to open it. if we do it manually and forgot to remove the label which will absolutely happen then we have the problem of the bot closing things it shouldn't close.\n00:35:00\nBrent Baude: Yeah. I'm not hearing enough to say that we shouldn't make a PR that's got the rule and\u2026\nBrent Baude: start trying to do this and see how it goes. Folks agree.\nTom Sweeney: No, I think everybody's pretty much in agreement.\nTom Sweeney: And are we going to document this in issue MD on the Podman site?\nBrent Baude: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think there's two pieces of work. there's the policy and then there's the sort of the automation and the message we're going to use. So, I have some ideas. I'll talk to Ashley to see if it's any even possible.\nMohan Boddu: Just wanted to say for currently we have set the sale date as period as 30 days as per the document.\nBrent Baude: It's good place to start.\nPaul Holzinger: 30 days is good as a number, but the issue with the stale body is it just doesn't work correctly. There are hundreds of issues\u2026\nPaul Holzinger: where it will not put ST on even if they are stale. So relying on that could be a problem. Yeah, absolutely.\nBrent Baude: I think there are lots of different stalebots,\u2026\nBrent Baude: Paul. Maybe part of the answer is we need a different one.\nPaul Holzinger: Just mentioning that if there's automation then it must be consistent.\nBrent Baude: Okay, Matt, I would say we've made good progress on at least one.  And maybe that's how we need to do this because just trying to wrap our arms around the whole thing is probably a little daunting. So in the future we just talk about specific cases that we're trying to deal with.\nMatt Heon: I think that's reasonable. I'm hearing we might want a card for the automation around getting information from people. it sounds like that is something that's important to us.  Okay.\nBrent Baude: why don't you hang tight though? I think I kind of have a way I'd like to see this work and I want to talk to somebody like Paul or Ashley to see if I'm way out in left field.\nMatt Heon: Okay, reasonable enough. I conversation seems to be tapering off.  Tom, do you have anything else?\nTom Sweeney: I do not other than open form and\u2026\nTom Sweeney: questions if anybody has anything there topics for the next meeting or meetings. And while you're thinking about that, I'll just go through quickly that our next meeting for the PMAN community meeting, which is more of a demo meeting, although this one wasn't so much, is on June 3rd, 2025. And I will ask Nabia, and I apologize if I messed up your name badly, go ahead.\nNavya Sree: So I'm Nabia. I mean I just joined this meeting because I am doing some work on usage using the podman in my project. and I heard that the podman is a demonless and it can run with rootful and rootless access but I am trying to use podman on target service regarding some work in my project.  So will that be possible? Can I use a podman inside the Fargate service since the far is serverless? I don't know how I can use that podman inside that service. I have read all the documentation available in internet regarding the pod man but I'm failing to do that. So it would be so helpful. Can you give some guidance or do I have any documentation for that?\nMatt Heon: I don't really know. So, my understanding is that the AWS seroist stuff is containers itself. because of that podman in a container is possible but it usually requires elevated privileges from the outer container I mean.\n00:40:00\nMatt Heon: So it would have to be a privilege container usually.  Am I right about that?\nNavya Sree: Okay.\nNavya Sree: Then it means yeah I mean since AWS is serverless, it is managed completely by AWS. I do not have the privileged access for the underlying host. So it means that I cannot access pod manu inside the target service container image script.\nMatt Heon: Yeah, I sorry.\nDan Walsh: Yeah. Yeah.\nDan Walsh: In order to run a container on a rubless container, at least you need capset UID and capset G ID within the username space that they assign you. if you're running inside of a container, often they're going to give you just one UID or a group of UIDs. but they probably will not give you, so depends on how they set up the container. I'm not familiar with how they do it.  If you look for a blog called running Podman and Kubernetes, you'll see some of this discussion there. And that should help you figure out if it's even possible because usually it's going to be a permissions.\nDan Walsh: You're going to get permission errors.\nNavya Sree: Got it. and I sorry I have a small question. I mean I have created a user inside my Docker file by giving the UIDs and subids based upon the documentation. whenever I give the permissions to the user still the container is not running it is saying that it is exiting the container by saying that host keys is not found I mean do I need to create any SSH keys for the user because I'm not finding any related documentation is it\u2026\nTom Sweeney: Okay.\nNavya Sree: what I'm seeing\nDan Walsh: Yeah, I think it'd be best\u2026\nNavya Sree: Okay.\nDan Walsh: if you just open up an issue on GitHub or a discussion on GitHub and then people in this meeting can correspond with you because we'd have to really see what you're doing inside of it and might be able to help you out or at least ask you appropriate questions for to look at the environment that you're running in.  So I think we should move this to open up a discussion on the GitHub page. Okay.\nNavya Sree: Okay, sounds good.\nNavya Sree: Thank you so much. Yeah, that's all I have. I had these couple of questions.\nTom Sweeney: Navia, I've added a link to the blog post that Dan was talking about in the Google chat here for you and\u2026\nTom Sweeney: I'll put it in the meeting notes as All right.  And then going back to the meeting schedules that we've got coming up, we've got one coming up on May 6, the Cabal meeting, which is more of a general discussion of things that should be happening within the project rather than demos. And that is it for upcoming meetings. So one last call. Any further questions or comments or topics of next time?  It's on. I'll wrap up and thank everybody for coming today and I'll stop the recording. Thanks Any unrecorded questions you want to make? Not hearing any.\nTom Sweeney: So given that I'm going to say thanks once again folks, special Dan and Brett and Matt for leading the discussions today and we'll see you next time.\nThis editable transcript was computer generated and might contain errors.
