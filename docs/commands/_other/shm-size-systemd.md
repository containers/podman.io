#### **--shm-size-systemd**=_number[unit]_

Size of systemd-specific tmpfs mounts such as /run, /run/lock, /var/log/journal and /tmp.
A _unit_ can be **b** (bytes), **k** (kibibytes), **m** (mebibytes), or **g** (gibibytes).
If the unit is omitted, the system uses bytes. If the size is omitted, the default is **64m**.
When _size_ is **0**, the usage is limited to 50% of the host's available memory.
