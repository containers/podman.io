Set environment variables.

This option allows arbitrary environment variables that are available for the process to be launched inside of the container. If an environment variable is specified without a value, Podman will check the host environment for a value and set the variable only if it is set on the host. As a special case, if an environment variable ending in **\*** is specified without a value, Podman will search the host environment for variables starting with the prefix and will add those variables to the container.
