#### **--mount**=_type=TYPE,TYPE-SPECIFIC-OPTION[,...]_

Attach a filesystem mount to the container

Current supported mount TYPEs are **bind**, **volume**, **image**, **tmpfs** and **devpts**. <sup>[[1]](#Footnote1)</sup>

       e.g.

       type=bind,source=/path/on/host,destination=/path/in/container

       type=bind,src=/path/on/host,dst=/path/in/container,relabel=shared

       type=bind,src=/path/on/host,dst=/path/in/container,relabel=shared,U=true

       type=volume,source=vol1,destination=/path/in/container,ro=true

       type=tmpfs,tmpfs-size=512M,destination=/path/in/container

       type=image,source=fedora,destination=/fedora-image,rw=true

       type=devpts,destination=/dev/pts

       Common Options:

          · src, source: mount source spec for bind and volume. Mandatory for bind.

          · dst, destination, target: mount destination spec.

       Options specific to volume:

          · ro, readonly: true or false (default).

          . U, chown: true or false (default). Change recursively the owner and group of the source volume based on the UID and GID of the container.

          · idmap: true or false (default).  If specified, create an idmapped mount to the target user namespace in the container.
          The idmap option supports a custom mapping that can be different than the user namespace used by the container.
          The mapping can be specified after the idmap option like: `idmap=uids=0-1-10#10-11-10;gids=0-100-10`.  For each triplet, the first value is the
          start of the backing file system IDs that are mapped to the second value on the host.  The length of this mapping is given in the third value.
          Multiple ranges are separated with #.  If the specified mapping is prepended with a '@' then the mapping is considered relative to the container
          user namespace. The host ID for the mapping is changed to account for the relative position of the container user in the container user namespace.

       Options specific to image:

          · rw, readwrite: true or false (default).

       Options specific to bind:

          · ro, readonly: true or false (default).

          · bind-propagation: shared, slave, private, unbindable, rshared, rslave, runbindable, or rprivate(default). See also mount(2).

          . bind-nonrecursive: do not set up a recursive bind mount. By default it is recursive.

          . relabel: shared, private.

          · idmap: true or false (default).  If specified, create an idmapped mount to the target user namespace in the container.

          . U, chown: true or false (default). Change recursively the owner and group of the source volume based on the UID and GID of the container.

       Options specific to tmpfs:

          · ro, readonly: true or false (default).

          · tmpfs-size: Size of the tmpfs mount in bytes. Unlimited by default in Linux.

          · tmpfs-mode: File mode of the tmpfs in octal. (e.g. 700 or 0700.) Defaults to 1777 in Linux.

          · tmpcopyup: Enable copyup from the image directory at the same location to the tmpfs. Used by default.

          · notmpcopyup: Disable copying files from the image to the tmpfs.

          . U, chown: true or false (default). Change recursively the owner and group of the source volume based on the UID and GID of the container.

       Options specific to devpts:

          · uid: UID of the file owner (default 0).

          · gid: GID of the file owner (default 0).

          · mode: permission mask for the file (default 600).

          · max: maximum number of PTYs (default 1048576).
