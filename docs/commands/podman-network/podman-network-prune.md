## NAME

podman\-network\-prune - Remove all unused networks

## SYNOPSIS

**podman network prune** [*options*]

## DESCRIPTION

Remove all unused networks. An unused network is defined by a network which
has no containers connected or configured to connect to it. It will not remove
the so-called default network which goes by the name of _podman_.

## OPTIONS

#### **--filter**

Provide filter values.

The _filters_ argument format is of `key=value`. If there is more than one _filter_, then pass multiple OPTIONS: **--filter** _foo=bar_ **--filter** _bif=baz_.

Supported filters:

| Filter  | Description                                                                                        |
| :-----: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _label_ | Only remove networks, with (or without, in the case of label!=[...] is used) the specified labels. |
| _until_ | Only remove networks created before given timestamp.                                               |

The `label` _filter_ accepts two formats. One is the `label`=_key_ or `label`=_key_=_value_, which removes networks with the specified labels. The other format is the `label!`=_key_ or `label!`=_key_=_value_, which removes networks without the specified labels.

The `until` _filter_ can be Unix timestamps, date formatted timestamps, or Go duration strings (e.g. 10m, 1h30m) computed relative to the machineâ€™s time.

#### **--force**, **-f**

Do not prompt for confirmation
