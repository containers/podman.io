# How to use libpod for custom/derivative projects

libpod today is a Golang library and a CLI. The choice of interface you make has advantages and disadvantages.

## Using the REST API

Advantages:

- Stable, versioned API
- Language-agnostic
- [Well-documented](http://docs.podman.io/en/latest/_static/api.html) API

Disadvantages:

- Error handling is less verbose than Golang API
- May be slower

## Running as a subprocess

Advantages:

- Many commands output JSON
- Works with languages other than Golang
- Easy to get started

Disadvantages:

- Error handling is harder
- May be slower
- Can't hook into or control low-level things like how images are pulled

## Vendoring into a Go project

Advantages:

- Significant power and control

Disadvantages:

- You are now on the hook for container runtime security updates (partially, `runc`/`crun` are separate)
- Binary size
- Potential skew between multiple libpod versions operating on the same storage can cause problems

## Making the choice

A good question to ask first is: Do you want users to be able to use `podman` to manipulate the containers created by your project?
If so, that makes it more likely that you want to run `podman` as a subprocess or using the HTTP API. If you want a separate image store and a fundamentally
different experience; if what you're doing with containers is quite different from those created by the `podman` CLI,
that may drive you towards vendoring.
