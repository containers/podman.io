#### **--cache-to**=*image*

Set this flag to specify a remote repository that is used to store cache images. Buildah attempts to
push newly built cache image to the remote repository.

Note: Use the `--cache-from` option in order to use cache content in a remote repository.

Example

```bash
# populate a cache and also consult it
buildah build -t test --layers --cache-to registry/myrepo/cache --cache-from registry/myrepo/cache .
```

Note: `--cache-to` option is ignored unless `--layers` is specified.
