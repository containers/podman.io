Overrides the first `FROM` instruction within the Containerfile.  If there are multiple
FROM instructions in a Containerfile, only the first is changed.

With the remote podman client, not all container transports work as
expected. For example, oci-archive:/x.tar references /x.tar on the remote
machine instead of on the client. When using podman remote clients it is
best to restrict use to *containers-storage*, and *docker:// transports*.
