#### **--userns-uid-map-user**=*user*

Specifies that a UID mapping to be used to set ownership, at the
filesystem level, on the working container's contents, can be found in entries in the `/etc/subuid` file which correspond to the specified user.
Commands run when handling `RUN` instructions defaults to being run in
their own user namespaces, configured using the UID and GID maps.
If --userns-gid-map-group is specified, but --userns-uid-map-user is not specified, `podman` assumes that the specified group name is also a
suitable user name to use as the default setting for this option.

**NOTE:** When this option is specified by a rootless user, the specified mappings are relative to the rootless user namespace in the container, rather than being relative to the host as it is when run rootful.
