#### **--isolation**=*type*

Controls what type of isolation is used for running processes as part of `RUN`
instructions.  Recognized types include *oci* (OCI-compatible runtime, the
default), *rootless* (OCI-compatible runtime invoked using a modified
configuration and its --rootless option enabled, with *--no-new-keyring
--no-pivot* added to its *create* invocation, with network and UTS namespaces
disabled, and IPC, PID, and user namespaces enabled; the default for
unprivileged users), and *chroot* (an internal wrapper that leans more toward
chroot(1) than container technology).

Note: You can also override the default isolation type by setting the
BUILDAH\_ISOLATION environment variable.  `export BUILDAH_ISOLATION=oci`
