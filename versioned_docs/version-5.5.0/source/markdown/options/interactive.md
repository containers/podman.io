#### **--interactive**, **-i**

When set to **true**, make stdin available to the contained process. If **false**, the stdin of the contained process is empty and immediately closed.

If attached, stdin is piped to the contained process. If detached, reading stdin will block until later attached.

**Caveat:** Podman will consume input from stdin as soon as it becomes available, even if the contained process doesn't request it.
