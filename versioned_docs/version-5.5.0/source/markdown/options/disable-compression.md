#### **--disable-compression**, **-D**

Don't compress filesystem layers when building the image unless it is required
by the location where the image is being written.  This is the default setting,
because image layers are compressed automatically when they are pushed to
registries, and images being written to local storage only need to be
decompressed again to be stored.  Compression can be forced in all cases by
specifying **--disable-compression=false**.
