Sets the configuration for UTS namespaces when handling `RUN` instructions.
The configured value can be "" (the empty string) or "container" to indicate that a new UTS namespace to be created, or it can be "host" to indicate that the UTS namespace in which `podman` itself is being run is reused, or it can be the path to a UTS namespace which is already in use by another process.
