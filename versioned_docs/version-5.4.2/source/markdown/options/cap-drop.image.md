#### **--cap-drop**=*CAP\_xxx*

When executing RUN instructions, run the command specified in the instruction
with the specified capability removed from its capability set.
The CAP\_CHOWN, CAP\_DAC\_OVERRIDE, CAP\_FOWNER,
CAP\_FSETID, CAP\_KILL, CAP\_NET\_BIND\_SERVICE, CAP\_SETFCAP,
CAP\_SETGID, CAP\_SETPCAP, and CAP\_SETUID capabilities are
granted by default; this option can be used to remove them.

If a capability is specified to both the **--cap-add** and **--cap-drop**
options, it is dropped, regardless of the order in which the options were
given.
