Meeting start 11:02 a.m. Thursday October 4, 2022

### Quadlet/Kubernetes yaml support - (0:50 in video) - Valentin Rothberg

- Boils down to podman systemd integration
- Recently married systemd and kubenetes integration we have
  - escaping via systemd-escape and a yaml file
  - can give simple k8s yaml files to systemd
- quadlet is good for edge use cases, automotive
  - reallign quadlet with podman
  - future would be to move to a podman generate quadlet workflow instead of generate systemd

### ZSTD Support - (18:29 in video) Dan Walsh

- We have support for this, can be specified in oci what compresion standard to use
- everyone uses gzip, but zstd gives better compression
- when only one file in an image has changed, when you go to pull the update it pulls down the whole image even thoug only one thing has changed
- we have added support to podman to determine what has changed and only pull down those changes and not the whole image
- have opened PRs to containerd and docker to support zstd format, they have bene merged but there is no official release
- older versions of docker will be unhappy with the newer version of compression if we start pushing this everywhere
- stuck in a state trying to figure out how we support older version of docker
- suggestion is to push both versions, gzip and zstd, to the registry and they can be stored under the same name and manifest. But add an annotation/label to the image to identify which compression is used in the image
  - penalty will be pushing two images instead of just one to support both formats
  - if you know your environment will work with zstd no need to push both versions
  - for older container engines, recommendation would be to push with both formats
- proposal that is being worked on and we are making sure it works correctly
- What is the endgame
  - when enough people are no longer on the older container engines we can push for zstd only (may take about 2 years to switch the standard to ZSTD)

### Confidential Computing - (27:05 in video) Dan Walsh

- Needs to compress and encrypt the application
- Encrypt the image and push it, but the image should have the same name
- When you want to run the image in confidential mode, need to make sure you pull down the confidential image
  - the image manifest will differentiate which one is confidential and which is not
- Still debating what exactly this should be but will have an article out on this soon

### Landlock Support - (31:13 in video) Dan Walsh

- New security mechanism in the linux kernel
- it allows you to specifiy certain paths to an application in such a way that only those paths are allowed to use the app
- for example allows podman to say I am only going to write to /var/lib/containers and if it tries to write to any other location it will be blocked
- want to use this to protect podman from itself
- currently looking into it and researching what needs to be done
- There is a PR open for getting this into the runtime spec
  - https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/pull/1111
- Will landlock work well with volumes? How difficult will it be to use landlock for container control?

### Podman desktop packaging - (35:52 in video) Lokesh Mandvekar

- Background reading: https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/112
- Someone has done the packaging and it is avaiable on OBS
- Ask is to support it on official fedora
- Require to package electron (RH may not want to support this)
- Goal is to be able to do "dnf install podman-desktop"
- electron is embedded in podman-desktop and we are providing the package for brew on mac

### Podman kube apply - (49:42 in video) Urvashi Mohnani

- kube apply lets you deploy the generated kube yaml to a k8s cluster directly
- need to pass the kubeconfig file so that correct key and certifactes can be gathered for authentication
- use the k8s API endpoint to make the request to create the k8s resource
- supported types are pods, volumes, and services
  - this can be extended as we add more support to podman generate kube
- Possible features, pass in a container or podname instead of a kube yaml to deploy to the k8s cluster
- get the kube yaml for something already running in a k8s cluster

Joseph Gooch: Currently in quadlet ^^^

00:14:00.468,00:14:03.468
Joseph Gooch: https://github.com/containers/quadlet  From the readme, the file formats and container setup docs are very readable (and exciting)

00:16:00.536,00:16:03.536
Valentin Rothberg: Here's a doc: https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/kubernetes_support.md

00:16:52.968,00:16:55.968
Reinhard Tartler: I completely missed that documentation. I'll check whether it's included in the Debian package!

Sally O'Malley: Thanks, Valentin!

00:18:33.328,00:18:36.328
Joseph Gooch: Another comment on Quadlet - moving it towards golang, and introducing GoLang text templates would be pretty killer

00:19:24.193,00:19:27.193
Valentin Rothberg: Thanks for the questions and feedback! Please reach out if you have any questions.

For updates, I suggest following this GitHub issue: https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/15686

00:26:17.470,00:26:20.470
Sally O'Malley: Is there a podman issue for the zstd support?

00:27:16.513,00:27:19.513
Valentin Rothberg: @Sally: Podman already supports ZSTD but there is no issue (yet) for the idea of shipping an image in GZIP and ZSTD in a manifest list (or "image index" in OCI terminology)

00:27:27.585,00:27:30.585
Sally O'Malley: thanks, got it
