# Podman.io Website README

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).

### Build Locally

Follow these steps to test the site with either a local development server, or by statically generating the site.

- [_make sure yarn is installed_](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/docs/install/)
- Install packages
  - `$ yarn`
- Run a local development server
  - `$ yarn start`
- Generate static content (this is how the site is built for production)
  - `$ yarn build`
    - After this you can test the local build with:
      - `yarn serve`

To test with the `https`, follow the following steps:

- Generate the localhost self-signed certificate and install it (uses `mkcert` tool):
  - `$ mkcert localhost`
  - `$ mkcert -install`
- Start the local development server with HTTPS enabled:
  - `$ HTTPS=true SSL_CERT_FILE=localhost.pem SSL_KEY_FILE=localhost-key.pem yarn start`


#### Testing on your Virtual Machine

If you're doing development on a VM there are a few steps to take to test your changes:

- Set your firewall of your VM to allow access to port `3000`. These commands only have to be run once for the lifetime of the VM, or until you reconfigure your firewall settings.
  - `# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=3000/tcp`
  - `# firewall-cmd --reload`
- As noted above, build and start your web server after your proposed changes are complete:
  - `$ yarn build`
  - `$ yarn serve`
- On the host machine of your VM, open a web browser and connect to the IP of your VM:
  - `http://#.#.#.#:3000`
  - Note, `http` and NOT `https`, and `#.#.#.#` is your VM's TCP/IP address, such as `10.0.0.1`

### Deployment

- The site is set to automatically deploy when code is pushed to the main branch
  - See `.github/workflows/static.yml`
- **Important**: prior to merging to main, run `yarn build` locally

## How to Update the Podman.io Website

### Page Content

_Text and Images_

- Most page data is stored in `static/data/<page-name>`
  - It is set up so that you can use markdown in the strings for much of the content.
    - _If the markdown syntax renders, it needs to be passed into the `Markdown` component (in `components/utilities/`)_
- files like `static/data/globa.ts`, `static/data/testimonials.ts`, and `static/data/meetings.ts` are meant to make it easier for people with limited coding experience to be able to quickly update specific and regularly changing content.
  - **note**: the `papaparse` library has been added for switching to `.csv` files in the future.

### Page Style and Structure

#### Pages Pattern

- Fat arrow notation for sections that only appear on the particular page
  - These sections are organized in an exported function at the end of the file
- Large sections
  - some content takes up a lot of space and may be useful elsewhere or temporary, they can be found in `src/components/content/`
    - Components in this directory should be self sufficient for data (but it's not necessary of course)

#### Components

- `src/components/content`: Self-sufficient components, large page content components, temporary components
- `src/components/layout`: Headers, grids, and any other sections that organize content
- `src/components/shapes`: SVG components such as the wave border
- `src/components/ui`: Reusable components, little to no data by default, presentational
- `src/components/utilities`: Buttons, links, and other small reusable elements

### Typescript

- a bunch of base types are found in `typs.d.ts`
  - these are primarily for props. Kept minimal by design and then extended when needed (primarily with style props)

### Assets

#### CSS

- Podman and Podman Desktop color themes are added in `tailwind.config.js`
- A custom radial gradient has also been added to `tailwind.config.js` (it uses the same breakpoints as other tailwind gradients)
- changes to the default styles are in `src/assets/css/main.css` in the following order:
  - imports
  - docusaurus root colors
  - docusarus component style changes
  - font configuration
- default fonts are set inside `@layer base{}` in `main.css` using tailwind's **@apply** syntax

---

## Configuration Information

### How to Update Docusaurus

- Run the following command to upgrade docusaurus
  - `yarn up @docusaurus/core@latest @docusaurus/preset-classic@latest`
- _note that the docusaurus site says to use `upgrade` but it's actually `up` when using yarn_
- to upgrade tailwind or other packages, similarly use the command:
  - `yarn up <package-name>`

### Plugins and Libraries

- Icon Library: [Iconify](https://iconify.design/)
  - [Icones](https://icones.js.org/) for web based icon library overview
  - [Iconify Intellisense vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=antfu.iconify)
- CSS Framework: [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) (see `tailwind.config.js`, `assets/css/main.css`)
- Code Formatting: [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) (see `.prettierrc`, `.prettierignore`)
- Linting: [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) (see `.eslintrc`, `.eslintignore`)
- Rendering markdown from js strings: [react markdown parser](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown)
  - Use the custom `<Markdown text="..." styles="..." /> component for any markdown strings
    - This component wraps the markdown parser in `<BrowserOnly>{() => <ReactMarkdown />}</BrowserOnly>` and handles the lazy loading and imports, reducing the amount of code needed on each instance.
- Rendering html from wordpress: [html-react-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-react-parser)
  - Use this to render any injected html to avoid XSS
