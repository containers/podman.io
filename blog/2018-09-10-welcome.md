# Welcome to the [podman.io](https://podman.io) website!

If you've missed the news so far, CoreOS was acquired by Red Hat at the beginning of 2018. This also means some changes for Buildah and Podman.

Buildah and Podman were previously projects within Project Atomic which is going to be sunset in favor of an immutable host combination of Container Linux and Fedora Atomic Host: this combination is called [Fedora CoreOS](https://coreos.fedoraproject.org). We therefore welcome you to the new websites, [buildah.io](https://buildah.io) and [podman.io](https://podman.io) where you will find news, announcements, and more around the respective projects.

To start it up, check out the new [Blogs](https://podman.io/blogs) and [Releases](https://podman.io/releases) sections on the site.
