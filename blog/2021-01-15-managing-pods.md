# Podman&#58; Managing pods and containers in a local container runtime

## By Brent Baude [GitHub](https://github.com/baude)

Podman has the ability to handle pod deployment which is a differentiator from other container runtimes. [Brent Baude](https://twitter.com/bbaude) explains the how to in a recent blog post on the [Red Hat Enable Sysadmin](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/) site, [Podman: Managing pods and containers in a local container runtime](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/01/15/podman-managing-containers-pods/). This functionality is now available in the upstream version of Podman if you want to take a sneak peak.
