My latest blog post has just hit [Enable Sysadmin](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/). In the
[May the Fourth be with you via Podman](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/may-fourth-podman) post,
I delve into running an Ascii movie featureing the first Star Wars Movie inside of a container
run by Podman.

Enjoy and May the Fourth be with you!
