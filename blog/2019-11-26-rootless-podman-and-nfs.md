# Rootless Podman and NFS

## By Dan Walsh [GitHub](https://github.com/rhatdan)

Dan Walsh has another blog post on the [Red Hat Enable Sysadmin](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/) site this time about [Rootless Podman and NFS](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/rootless-podman-nfs). In the post Dan talks about how you can make some minor configuration changes to allow Podman to use a user's home directory on an NFS share. Give it a read!
