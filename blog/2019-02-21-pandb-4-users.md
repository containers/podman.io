# Podman and Buildah for Docker Users

## By Tom Sweeney [GitHub](https://github.com/TomSweeneyRedhat)

A new article about how Docker users can use Podman and Buildah on the [Red Hat Developer Site](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/02/21/podman-and-buildah-for-docker-users/). William Henry (@ipbabble) introduces the two tools to Docker users and explains how they can be used to replace Docker and how the two tools are related.
