# Building images using Podman and cron

## By Tom Sweeney [GitHub](https://github.com/TomSweeneyRedhat)

Tom Sweeney has another blog post on the [Red Hat Enable Sysadmin](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/) site this time he's writing about [Building images using Podman and cron](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/building-images-podman-cron). In the article Tom talks about how necessity became the mother of invention and cron was put into use to build container images on a regular schedule.
