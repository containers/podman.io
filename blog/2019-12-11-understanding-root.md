# Understanding root inside and outside a container

## By Tom Sweeney [GitHub](https://github.com/TomSweeneyRedhat)

Do you run containers as root, or as a regular user? Scott McCarty has a blog post on the [Red Hat Blog](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog) about this very subject, [Understanding root inside and outside a container](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/understanding-root-inside-and-outside-container). In the post Scott walks you through what a rootless container does and how it can be a safer alternative to a container run by root.
