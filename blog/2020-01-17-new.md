The new API for Podman, referred to as _apiv2_, has been merged into the [libpod](https://github.com/containers/podman/) repository. It's a simpler REST API that's more compatible with Docker implementations than the [varlink](https://varlink.org/) protocol that's currently in use. For more details, see this [release announcement](https://podman.io/blogs/2020/01/17/podman-new-api.html) by Brent Baude.
