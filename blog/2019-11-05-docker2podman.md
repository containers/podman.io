# Migrating from Docker to Podman

## By Tom Sweeney [GitHub](https://github.com/TomSweeneyRedhat)

Elliott Sales de Andrade's post on [Quantum Logic](https://qulogic.gitlab.io/), [Migrating from Docker to Podman](https://qulogic.gitlab.io/posts/2019-10-20-migrating-to-podman/) takes a look at his migration from Docker to Podman and a good assessment of where the Podman tool stands in comparison to Docker.
