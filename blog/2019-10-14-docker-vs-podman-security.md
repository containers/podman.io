## By Tom Sweeney [GitHub](https://github.com/TomSweeneyRedhat)

Ganesh Mani discusses why Podman is more secure than Docker [here](https://cloudnweb.dev/2019/10/heres-why-podman-is-more-secured-than-docker-devsecops/) on the [CLOUDNWEB](https://cloudnweb.dev/) site. Ganesh talks about why Podman's fork and execute model is more secure than Docker's client server model.
