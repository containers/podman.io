# Say “Hello” to Buildah, Podman, and Skopeo

## By Tom Sweeney [GitHub](https://github.com/TomSweeneyRedhat)

Saharsh Singh talks about how he's moved on from his Docker daemon and moved on to Podman, Buildah and Skopeo [here](https://servicesblog.redhat.com/2019/10/09/say-hello-to-buildah-podman-and-skopeo/?sc_cid=701f2000000txokAAA&utm_source=bambu&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=abm) on the Red Hat Service Blog site. Saharsh walks you through a history of container tools and then talks about Podman, Buildah and Skopeo with a lot of great examples.
