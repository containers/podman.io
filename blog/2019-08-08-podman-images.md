# Command Highlight&#58; podman images

## By Tom Sweeney [GitHub](https://github.com/TomSweeneyRedhat)

A quick [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) demo highlighting what the `podman images` command can do. A great way to get quickly immersed with this command in just a few minutes time. Checkout the demo [here](https://podman.io/asciinema/podman/images/) and if you want to run the script yourself, it can be found [here](https://github.com/containers/Demos/blob/main/podman_cli/podman_images.sh).
