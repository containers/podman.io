# Leasing routable IP addresses with Podman containers

## By Brent Baude [GitHub](https://github.com/baude)

Brent Baude has another blog post on the [Red Hat Enable Sysadmin](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/) site this time about [Leasing routable IP addresses with Podman containers](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/leasing-ips-podman). In the post Brent talks about using the macvlan and the dhcp plugins that ship with the container-networking project in order to lease ip addresses for your containers.
